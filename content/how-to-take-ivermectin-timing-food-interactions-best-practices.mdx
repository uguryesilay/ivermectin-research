## When Should You Take Ivermectin?

![When Should You Take Ivermectin?](/images/how-to-take-ivermectin-timing-food-interactions-best-practices-when-should-you-take-ivermectin.webp)


It is very important to know the best time to take ivermectin. Taking it at the right time makes it work better and lowers the chance of [side effects](/safety-side-effects/ivermectin-side-effects-complete-safety-guide "Ivermectin Side Effects: Complete Safety Guide"). Usually, you should take ivermectin on an empty stomach, about one hour before you eat. This helps your body get the most from the medicine and makes it work better.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always follow your healthcare provider’s instructions regarding the timing and dosing of ivermectin, as specific medical conditions or concurrent medications might necessitate adjustments.

### Consistency and Time of Day

Taking your medicine at the same time each day helps keep the amount in your blood steady. If you only need one dose, pick a time that fits your day. If you need many doses, try to take them at the same time each day. There is no strict rule about what time to take it, but morning may be best for those who like to take their medicine with other morning routines.

## Ivermectin and Food: What You Need to Know

![Ivermectin and Food: What You Need to Know](/images/how-to-take-ivermectin-timing-food-interactions-best-practices-ivermectin-and-food-what-you-need-to-know.webp)


It is important to know how food affects ivermectin. The medicine works best when you take it on an empty stomach. Food, especially fatty foods, can change how much of the drug your body takes in.

### What Happens If You Take Ivermectin with Food?

If you take ivermectin with food, your body may absorb more of the drug. This can make your blood levels higher than they should be. While that might seem good, it can also cause more **side effects** like dizziness, nausea, or rash. A study in the "Journal of Clinical Pharmacology" shows that food can make the medicine in your blood up to 2.5 times stronger.

> [!CAUTION]
> To avoid increased risk of **side effects**, take ivermectin on an empty stomach unless otherwise directed by your healthcare provider.

## Step-by-Step Administration Guide

![Step-by-Step Administration Guide](/images/how-to-take-ivermectin-timing-food-interactions-best-practices-step-by-step-administration-guide.webp)


Here is a simple guide on how to take ivermectin for people. It will help you take the right dose in the right way to get the best results:

1. Wash Your Hands: Start by washing your hands thoroughly with soap and water to ensure cleanliness.
2. Check the Dose: Confirm the correct dose as prescribed by your healthcare provider. **Ivermectin** tablets come in different strengths, so it's important to take the right one.
3. Prepare the Tablet: Do not crush or chew the tablet. Swallow it whole with water.
4. Timing: Take the tablet on an empty stomach, ideally one hour before a meal.
5. Avoid Lying Down: Stay upright (sitting or standing) for about 10-15 minutes after taking the medication to help it pass through your esophagus.

## Water and Hydration Requirements

![Water and Hydration Requirements](/images/how-to-take-ivermectin-timing-food-interactions-best-practices-water-and-hydration-requirements.webp)


Drink enough water when taking ivermectin. It helps you swallow the pill and gets the medicine into your stomach.

### Importance of Hydration

Good hydration helps your body process and remove the medicine better. You don’t need to drink a lot, but a glass (about 8 ounces) is enough when you take the pill.

&gt; You can learn more about staying hydrated in our article on [the importance of hydration in medication administration](#).

## What to Do If You Miss a Dose

![What to Do If You Miss a Dose](/images/how-to-take-ivermectin-timing-food-interactions-best-practices-what-to-do-if-you-miss-a-dose.webp)


If you miss a dose of ivermectin, it is good to know what steps to take.

### Steps to Follow:

1. Take It As Soon As You Remember: If you realize you've missed a dose and it's still relatively close to the time you should have taken it, go ahead and take it.
2. Skip If Close to Next Dose: If it’s almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular schedule.
3. Never Double Up: Do not take two doses at the same time to make up for a missed dose. This can increase the risk of side effects.

&gt; For more tips on missed doses of other medicines, see our [guide on managing missed doses safely](#).

## Foods and Drinks to Avoid

![Foods and Drinks to Avoid](/images/how-to-take-ivermectin-timing-food-interactions-best-practices-foods-and-drinks-to-avoid.webp)


Some foods and drinks can make ivermectin less safe or less strong.

### Alcohol

Avoid alcohol while taking ivermectin. It can make side effects like dizziness and nausea worse. Drinking alcohol may also make it harder to drive or work safely.

### Grapefruit

Grapefruit and grapefruit juice can change how your body breaks down ivermectin. This can cause higher levels of the medicine in your blood and more side effects.

> [!CAUTION]
> Avoid consuming grapefruit or grapefruit juice while taking ivermectin to prevent unintended [drug interactions](/safety-side-effects/ivermectin-drug-interactions-what-you-cannot-take-together "Ivermectin Drug Interactions: What You Cannot Take Together").
