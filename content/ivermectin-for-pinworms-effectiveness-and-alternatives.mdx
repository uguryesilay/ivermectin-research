Ivermectin is a drug that has gotten a lot of attention for treating many [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness "Ivermectin for Parasites: Types Treated and Effectiveness"). But when it comes to pinworms, it has some limits. Pinworms, known scientifically as Enterobius vermicularis, are common parasites, especially in kids. While ivermectin works against many parasites, it is less effective against pinworms than other drugs made just for them.

**Ivermectin** works by stopping the nerves and muscles of parasites, which makes them paralyze and die. This process works well for many parasites. But pinworms are more resistant. Studies show that ivermectin cures fewer pinworm cases than other medicines. A study in the Journal of Pediatric Infectious Diseases says ivermectin is less effective than drugs like pyrantel pamoate and **mebendazole**.

While ivermectin is safe for most people, using it to treat pinworms without a doctor’s guidance can leave some worms alive and symptoms may stay.

It’s important to know which medicines work best. The key question is whether ivermectin can kill pinworms. It might affect them, but there are better medicines that do a more reliable job.

These better medicines are well known and are the first choice for doctors. 

Pyrantel pamoate is one. It works by blocking the worms’ nerves so they paralyze. The worms are then pushed out by the body. It is available over-the-counter in many places. Studies show it cures over 90% of pinworm cases.

Mebendazole is another. It blocks worms from taking in sugar, which makes them die. Its cure rate can be as high as 95% after one dose. It works well because it targets worms like pinworms.

**Albendazole** is similar to mebendazole. It also stops worms from taking in sugar. It is very effective and has similar cure rates. Doctors often choose it when other drugs are not available or when they want a broader treatment.

While ivermectin is a strong drug, it is not the first pick for pinworms for these reasons.

According to the WHO and CDC, ivermectin is not part of the main treatment plans for pinworms. They recommend pyrantel pamoate, mebendazole, or albendazole. That is why pinworm ivermectin use is not common. For more on drug rules, see the article on Protected 5.

There are some cases where doctors may think about using ivermectin for pinworms. 

If the usual drugs do not work or if a patient cannot take them, a doctor might choose ivermectin. 

For example, if a patient has bad reactions to mebendazole or pyrantel pamoate and still has pinworms, a doctor might pick ivermectin. They will watch the patient closely to see if it helps or causes [side effects](/safety-side-effects/ivermectin-side-effects-complete-safety-guide "Ivermectin Side Effects: Complete Safety Guide").
