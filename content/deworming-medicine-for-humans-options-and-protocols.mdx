Deworming medicine for humans helps treat infections caused by worms that can harm health. Knowing the options helps make good choices for different needs. The main medicines are **ivermectin**, **albendazole**, and **mebendazole**. Each has special uses and facts.

**Ivermectin** is a medicine that fights many [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness "Ivermectin for Parasites: Types Treated and Effectiveness"). It is used for infections like river blindness, strongyloidiasis, and [scabies](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-scabies-treatment-protocol-and-success-rates "Ivermectin for Scabies: Treatment Protocol and Success Rates"). It works by making the parasites stop moving and die. The World Health Organization (WHO) says **ivermectin** is good for large-scale use in areas where these infections are common.

Use and dose: Usually, one dose taken by mouth is enough. The dose depends on the infection and the person’s weight.

[Side effects](/safety-side-effects/ivermectin-side-effects-complete-safety-guide "Ivermectin Side Effects: Complete Safety Guide"): Common **side effects** are dizziness, nausea, and diarrhea. Rarely, it can cause serious reactions, especially if there are many parasites.

Albendazole is effective against many worms like tapeworms, roundworms, and flukes. It works by stopping the worms from taking in glucose. This causes the worms to die. 

Use and dose: It is often given as one dose for mild cases, or for longer if the infection is severe, like neurocysticercosis.

**Side effects**: Possible side effects are stomach pain, nausea, and headache. Long use can affect the liver, so check liver function if used for a long time.

Mebendazole mostly treats infections from pinworms, whipworms, and hookworms. It stops the worms from taking up glucose.

Use and dose: Usually one dose, but sometimes more doses are needed.

Side effects: It is usually safe. Some may get stomach upset or, rarely, liver problems with long use.

In some cases, deworming pills are sold over the counter. They are easy to get and can treat common infections at home. Pyrantel pamoate is one such drug. It is often used for pinworms and some other worms.

Pyrantel pamoate works by paralyzing the worms. Then the worms are expelled through the gut.

Availability: This medicine can often be bought without a **prescription** in many countries.

Use and dose: Usually, a single dose is enough. Sometimes, a second dose two weeks later is used to stop reinfection.

Side effects: Mild, such as nausea, headache, or dizziness.

Sometimes, over-the-counter drugs are not enough, and prescription medicines are needed. This may be true for severe infections or less common cases.

Prescription medicines are needed when: infections do not get better with over-the-counter drugs, for vulnerable groups like pregnant women or people with weak immune systems, or if the infection can cause serious problems, such as neurocysticercosis.

Some prescription drugs are **praziquantel**, for schistosomiasis and liver fluke infections, and diethylcarbamazine, for lymphatic filariasis.

Praziquantel works by making the parasite’s cell membranes more permeable. This paralyzes and kills them.

Diethylcarbamazine is used for some worm infections. It is usually given over several days.

Routine deworming is key in places where worms are common. The WHO recommends mass drug programs to cut down infections.

In areas with many cases, routine deworming aims to: lower infection rates in the community, prevent problems like malnutrition and anemia, and boost public health.

How often deworming is done depends on how many people have worms. It can be once or twice a year. Children, women who are pregnant, and workers in risky jobs are often given deworming medicine first.

Deworming for adults and children is different. Children get lower doses, often in liquid form. Mebendazole and pyrantel pamoate are common for kids with pinworms and roundworms. Adults often take higher doses in pill form. Albendazole and ivermectin are common for more serious cases.

Deciding if someone needs deworming depends on physical check-ups and tests. Sometimes, treatment is given just based on symptoms. Other times, tests are needed to be sure.

- Stool tests can find eggs or worms of some parasites.  
- Blood tests may show infections like filariasis.  
- X-ray or scans are sometimes needed to find more deep infections.  

Empiric Treatment:  

- In areas where these bugs are common, treatment may start based on symptoms alone.  
- It is also often used when tests are not available or too hard to do.  

Scenarios for Testing:  

- Symptoms last a long time or come back after treatment.  
- There is doubt about a rare parasite.  
- Signs of more serious infection or complications.
