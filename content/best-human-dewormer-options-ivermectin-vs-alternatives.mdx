[Parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness "Ivermectin for Parasites: Types Treated and Effectiveness") are tiny life forms that live on or inside a host and get nutrients from it, at the host’s cost. In rich countries, some parasites are more common because people travel and move from place to place. Knowing which parasites need treatment helps pick the right medicine for humans.

Parasites can cause health issues, so it’s key to have medicines that kill them. **Ivermectin** is one such medicine. It is recognized as a strong treatment for many parasitic infections. It has been approved by the FDA and works by paralyzing and killing the parasites.

**Ivermectin** is mainly used to treat several parasites such as strongyloides, **onchocerciasis**, and others.

A research paper in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that ivermectin reduces the number of parasites and helps with symptoms in patients with **strongyloidiasis**. This makes it a top choice among deworming drugs for certain infections.

While ivermectin works well, there are other drugs available. Each works for different types of parasites and has its own benefits.

One such drug is **albendazole**. It is effective against many parasites, including roundworms, hookworms, and tapeworms. It works by stopping the growth of the parasites’ tiny tubes called microtubules, which are needed for their survival. People usually take it in one dose or over several days. The World Health Organization recommends it for different types of intestinal worms.

Another drug is **mebendazole**. It mainly treats pinworms, roundworms, and hookworms. It works by causing paralysis in worms so they are pushed out of the body. It is usually given as one dose, sometimes with a second dose after a few weeks. A study in The Lancet showed it is effective for treating ascariasis in [children](/dosage-administration/ivermectin-for-kids-pediatric-safety-and-dosing "Ivermectin for Kids: Pediatric Safety and Dosing").

**Praziquantel** is another option. It is used mainly against tapeworms and schistosomiasis. It works by making the parasite’s cell membranes more permeable, causing paralysis and death. It is given as a single dose and has been shown to work well in many studies, including those in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

While ivermectin is a strong choice for some infections, other medicines can be used depending on the parasite and the patient. Different drugs suit different needs, and doctors can help choose the best one. It’s also good to remember that some people use natural methods to fight parasites. But these should not replace medicines unless a doctor advises it.

When choosing a dewormer, consider if the medicine is OTC or needs a doctor’s [prescription](/buying-guide/how-to-get-ivermectin-prescription-and-access-guide "How to Get Ivermectin: Prescription and Access Guide"). Your health, age, and any other medicines you take are also important. A healthcare provider can give the best advice for your case.

To find the right medicine, think about the type of parasite you have. **Ivermectin** often works well for some infections, but other drugs like albendazole, mebendazole, and praziquantel also offer good options. Always talk with a healthcare provider to be sure your treatment is safe and right for you. Natural methods might help, but do not rely on them alone without professional advice.

In the end, picking the best dewormer depends on which parasite you have and what options are available. While ivermectin is a main choice for some infections, other drugs can help too. Always seek advice from a healthcare provider to get safe and effective treatment. Consider both medicines and natural methods when needed.
