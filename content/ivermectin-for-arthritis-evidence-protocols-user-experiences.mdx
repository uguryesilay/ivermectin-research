Arthritis is a common name for over 100 different joint diseases and conditions. It mainly affects the joints and causes pain, swelling, stiffness, and less movement. Two common types are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, each with different causes and treatments.

Osteoarthritis is the most common form. It happens when the cartilage that cushions the joint bones wears down. This usually affects older people and leads to pain, stiffness, and swelling. To treat it, people often change their habits, take pain meds, and sometimes have surgery.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease. In RA, the body's immune system wrongly attacks the joint lining, causing inflammation and damage. RA needs strong treatment using drugs that slow disease progress, called DMARDs, and special biological medicines.

People have looked into using ivermectin for arthritis, especially RA, because it may have anti-inflammatory effects. **Ivermectin** is mainly used to treat [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness "Ivermectin for Parasites: Types Treated and Effectiveness"), but new studies are checking if it can help with inflammation. These studies are still new, and most are small or on animals.

One study in the Journal of Inflammation Research looked at how ivermectin affected markers in RA patients. It showed some reduction in inflammatory substances, hinting it might help. Still, bigger and better studies are needed. Another study tested ivermectin on animals with arthritis. It found less swelling and pain, which suggests it could be used along with other treatments. But, without more solid tests in humans, its use is still limited.

If ivermectin is to be used for arthritis, especially RA, knowing how much to give is key. But there is no standard dose yet, because its use in this way is still experimental. Different studies have used different doses and forms, like pills or creams. Some studies used small doses over short times. Other times, it was applied directly to joints.

The main reason ivermectin might help RA is because it can lower inflammation and change immune responses. It can block some chemicals that cause joint damage. Specifically, ivermectin reduces cytokines like TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, which play a big role in RA. Lowering these may help decrease inflammation and stop joint damage.

**Ivermectin** also affects the immune system by influencing cells that keep the immune system balanced, called regulatory T-cells. This may help stop the immune system from attacking the joints. These effects suggest ivermectin could be added to existing treatments to help control inflammation and slow down the disease.

Some people with arthritis have tried ivermectin and shared their stories. Some saw less pain and swelling. They often felt stiffer in the morning but moved better. Usually, they took it along with their regular drugs. But others saw little or no change, and some had [side effects](/safety-side-effects/ivermectin-side-effects-complete-safety-guide "Ivermectin Side Effects: Complete Safety Guide") like stomach upset or skin irritation from creams. These mixed results show that treatments should be personal and carefully watched by a doctor.

It is important to think about how ivermectin works with other drugs for RA, like DMARDs and NSAIDs. Combining ivermectin with standard treatment might work better, but more research is needed. Good studies are needed to see if this approach can help and be safe.
