[Parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness "Ivermectin for Parasites: Types Treated and Effectiveness") can live in the human body. They range from tiny creatures to larger worms. Sometimes, they cause health problems. A parasite cleanse is a way to try to get rid of them. There are two main ways: medicines and natural remedies.

Medicines for parasites are well known. Doctors often give drugs like **Albendazole**, **Mebendazole**, or **Praziquantel**, depending on the parasite. These drugs are tested and known to work well. They are used when a person’s doctor diagnoses the infection.

Natural remedies for a parasite cleanse include herbs and supplements. These are often sold as parasite detox products. Common ingredients are black walnut, wormwood, and cloves. Many people like these options because they see them as gentle and natural. But, herbal remedies are not always proven to work. Their effects are not as well tested as medicines. Choosing between drugs and herbs depends on what is safe and best for each person.

**Ivermectin** is a well-known medicine used to treat some parasite infections. It is mainly used for conditions like **river blindness** and certain worm infections. It works by paralyzing the parasite, killing it. It is approved and proven effective for some infections. Some people consider using ivermectin in a parasite cleanse, but it should only be used if a doctor says so and after the infection is confirmed.

Herbal parasite supplements often have different herbs mixed together. Common ones are black walnut, wormwood, and cloves. Black walnut is thought to harm parasites because of a compound called juglone, but there is little solid proof of this. Wormwood has a compound called artemisinin, which fights malaria. It might help against other parasites, but more proof is needed. Cloves have eugenol, which is believed to have some antimicrobial effects. Still, using these alone for a parasite cleanse is not proven to be safe or effective.

Many people use parasite detox supplements. The proof for these is mixed. Some ingredients have been used for a long time, but full studies are few.

A good parasite cleanse may include both drugs and herbal supplements. This combined approach might work better and have fewer [side effects](/safety-side-effects/ivermectin-side-effects-complete-safety-guide "Ivermectin Side Effects: Complete Safety Guide").

The length of a parasite cleanse depends on the type of infection and the treatment used. It usually lasts a few days to a few weeks. Longer cleanses might be needed but should be checked by a doctor to stay safe and see if they work.

In a full parasite cleanse, things like binders and probiotics are often used. Binders like activated charcoal help with detox symptoms. Probiotics help keep the gut healthy.

For example, consider Mary, a woman who is doing a parasite cleanse. Her doctor told her to take ivermectin and herbal remedies. She also uses activated charcoal to reduce detox symptoms and probiotics for her digestion.
