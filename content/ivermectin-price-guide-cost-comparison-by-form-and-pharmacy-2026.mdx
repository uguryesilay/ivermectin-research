Understanding how much ivermectin costs can be very helpful for those who need this drug for health issues. The price of ivermectin can change a lot depending on its form — such as tablets, paste, liquid, or shot. Here, we look at each form to give a clear view of the price of ivermectin.

**Ivermectin** tablets are the most common form used for people. These are used to treat infections like **strongyloidiasis** and **onchocerciasis**. The cost of ivermectin tablets can vary based on whether you buy a generic or the brand name [Stromectol](/buying-guide/stromectol-brand-ivermectin-complete-guide-and-comparison "Stromectol (Brand Ivermectin): Complete Guide and Comparison"). As of 2026, generic tablets usually cost from $1 to $3 each, while Stromectol may be between $3 and $5 per tablet.

**Ivermectin** paste is used mostly in animals, especially horses. It is important to know that veterinary forms should not be used by humans. The price of ivermectin paste is usually from $5 to $15 per syringe. This contains enough medicine for one or more treatments in animals.

Liquid ivermectin is also used in animals and can have a different price. For farm animals, the cost for a 250 ml bottle of liquid ivermectin is about $30 to $50. Again, this form is not for humans.

Injectable ivermectin is another veterinary product used for animals. It is very important to say that injectable forms are not meant for humans. The price of ivermectin in a 50 ml vial can be from $40 to $70.

When buying ivermectin, the store you choose can make a big difference in price. Here is a comparison of prices at major stores like CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, and Costco.

At CVS, ivermectin tablets are usually from $1.50 to $3 per generic tablet, and $4 to $6 for the brand. CVS may also offer savings with membership or coupons.

Walgreens has similar prices, with generic tablets costing about $1.50 to $2.50, and brand names from $3.50 to $5. They also have a savings club that might help lower the cost.

Walmart is known to have low prices. Generic tablets can be $1 to $2 each, and brand names $3 to $4. Walmart also has programs to help reduce the price.

Costco often has good prices for medicines. The price for generic ivermectin tablets is about $1 to $2 each, and brand names are from $3 to $4. You need a membership to buy at Costco, but it can save you money on medicines.

Choosing between a generic and a brand-name drug often depends on price, quality, and how easy it is to find. Here, we look at the price difference between Stromectol and its generic versions.

Stromectol is the brand name for ivermectin and usually costs more. In 2026, the price per tablet for Stromectol is about $4 to $5. Generic ivermectin costs around $1 to $3 per tablet. Generic drugs are proven equal in strength and effect to the brand name by tests approved by the FDA. So, for those who want to save money, choosing generic ivermectin is often the best choice for quality and price.

As more people buy medicine online, it is good to look at the cost of ivermectin from these stores. However, buying from international online pharmacies can be cheaper because of different rules and costs. Still, there are risks with these buys, such as fake or poor-quality medicine. Prices can be as low as $0.50 to $2 per tablet, but buyers must be careful and check that the site is safe and trusted.

U.S. online pharmacies often have prices close to those in stores. Generic ivermectin tablets there can cost about $1 to $3 per pill. Websites like GoodRx can give extra coupons or discounts to lower the price of ivermectin.

If you have insurance, it can change how much you pay for ivermectin. Many plans cover it if it is used for approved health needs. How much you pay depends on your plan. It is best to call your insurer to learn what coverage you have.

**Ivermectin** is mainly used for approved things like strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis. Some plans may cover other uses if your doctor says they are needed.

> Verify with your insurance provider about coverage specifics and any required documentation or prior authorizations needed for ivermectin prescriptions.
