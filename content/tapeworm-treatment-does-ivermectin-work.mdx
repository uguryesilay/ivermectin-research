When it comes to treating parasitic infections, people often ask: does ivermectin kill tapeworms? To answer this, we need to look at [how ivermectin works](/research-mechanism/how-ivermectin-works-mechanism-of-action-explained) and what tapeworms are.

**Ivermectin** is a medicine that kills many types of [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness "Ivermectin for Parasites: Types Treated and Effectiveness"). It is mainly used to treat roundworms and [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness) like lice and mites. Its way of working involves making the parasite’s cell membranes more open to chloride ions. This causes the parasite to become paralyzed and die. However, tapeworms are a different kind of parasite.

Tapeworms, or cestodes, have a special body. They do not have the same chloride channels that ivermectin targets. Because of this, ivermectin cannot harm tapeworms. This is the main reason why ivermectin does not work for these parasites.

People often wonder, will ivermectin kill tapeworms? The answer is no. Instead, doctors use different medicines for tapeworms. The main medicine used is **praziquantel**. It works by causing the tapeworm’s muscles to spasm and stop moving. This makes the tapeworm detach from the intestine wall and leave the body. Many studies have shown that praziquantel works well to treat tapeworm infections.

Another good medicine is niclosamide. It kills tapeworms by messing with their energy use. Both praziquantel and niclosamide are the best options for treating tapeworms. The World Health Organization and other health groups agree with this.

People often mix up ivermectin and tapeworm medicine. This may come from seeing ivermectin work well against other parasites in people and animals. In animals, ivermectin is used for many parasite infections. This can make people think it also works for tapeworms. Online stories and rumors may also lead to this false idea. But it is important to trust science and expert advice for treatment.

If you want to learn more about the different kinds of parasites, you can read our article on [Parasite Types and Treatments](#).

When treating tapeworms, it is very important to use the right medicine. As we said, praziquantel and niclosamide are the best choices. Your doctor can help decide which medicine to give based on the type of tapeworm and your health. Usually, a single dose of praziquantel is enough. Niclosamide may need more doses. Always follow your doctor’s plan and finish all of the medicine. This helps make sure the infection is gone. Good hygiene, washing hands, cooking meat fully, and deworming pets can also help stop tapeworm infections.
