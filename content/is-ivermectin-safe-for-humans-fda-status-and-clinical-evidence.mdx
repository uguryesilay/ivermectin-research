Ivermectin is a drug used to kill [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness "Ivermectin for Parasites: Types Treated and Effectiveness"). It has been approved by the FDA for certain diseases. These are infections like river blindness and stomach worms. Doctors also use it off-label for [scabies](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-scabies-treatment-protocol-and-success-rates "Ivermectin for Scabies: Treatment Protocol and Success Rates") and lice. But the FDA has not approved it to treat or prevent COVID-19.

The FDA gave approval based on proof that ivermectin works well and is safe for these illnesses. When used in this way, it has a good safety record. Doctors may use it off-label, but this needs careful thought and judgment. The FDA warns against using ivermectin meant for animals. These are not tested for humans, and can be risky.

To ask if ivermectin is safe for humans, we look at how it has been used over the years. It has been used by millions of people around the world, especially where parasite infections are common. When used at the right dose for approved uses, it is usually safe. [Side effects](/safety-side-effects/ivermectin-side-effects-complete-safety-guide "Ivermectin Side Effects: Complete Safety Guide") are rare and mild, like dizziness, nausea, or stomach upset. Serious **[side effects](/safety-side-effects/ivermectin-side-effects-complete-safety-guide)** are very rare but can happen, so medical help is important.

A study from 1997 found that in people with **river blindness**, **side effects** were low. Most were mild skin reactions or fever. The drug was shown to be safe when used as directed.

We can also look at research data on ivermectin’s safety. Many studies show it is safe for most people. A review of trials found that side effects were similar to those who took a placebo. Most were mild and included headaches or stomach issues. A review of treatment for **[scabies](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-scabies-treatment-protocol-and-success-rates)** found that ivermectin worked well and was well tolerated, with few serious problems. These results show it is safe for approved uses.

Long-term or repeated use of ivermectin might carry some risk. We do not have enough data on very long use. Animal studies suggest high doses or long use could harm nerves, but this is not proven in humans. People who need repeated doses should see a doctor. Regular checkups can help find side effects early and keep treatment safe.

When asking if ivermectin is safe for people, we also need to know about groups that may be more at risk. For example, products made for animals are not safe for humans. Veterinary ivermectin comes in different forms and amounts. These are not made for humans and can cause **[overdose](/safety-side-effects/ivermectin-overdose-symptoms-treatment-safe-dosing)** or serious harm. The FDA warns against using animal ivermectin for humans. Using these can lead to hospital stays or worse.

Overall, when ivermectin is used for its approved uses, it is safe and works well. But using it for unapproved reasons, like COVID-19, is not backed by enough proof and can be risky. Formulas made for animals are especially dangerous to use. To stay safe, always follow a doctor’s advice. Talk to your doctor if you have questions or concerns. They can give advice that fits your health needs.
