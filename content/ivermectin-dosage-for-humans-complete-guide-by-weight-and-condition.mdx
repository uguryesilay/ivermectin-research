Ivermectin is a strong medicine used to fight [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness "Ivermectin for Parasites: Types Treated and Effectiveness") in people. It helps to clear infections if the dose is right. Giving the correct dose is key to making the medicine work and to keep people safe. In this part, we look at how to find the right amount of ivermectin, what the FDA says, and safety tips.

**Ivermectin** works by sticking to certain channels in the nerve and muscle cells of [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness). This causes the parasite to become paralyzed and die. This shows why it is important to give the right dose to remove the parasites without harming the person.

The FDA has approved ivermectin for some infections like **onchocerciasis** (river blindness), **strongyloidiasis**, and [scabies](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-scabies-treatment-protocol-and-success-rates "Ivermectin for Scabies: Treatment Protocol and Success Rates"). It is important to follow these rules and see a doctor before starting treatment. The FDA warns that ivermectin should not be used for unapproved reasons, such as COVID-19, because there is no good proof it works for that.

Finding the right dose depends on the person's weight. Below is a full guide that shows how to dose ivermectin based on weight in both kilograms and pounds.

This chart is a general guide. The actual dose can change based on health and other factors, so a doctor should decide the best dose.

The dose of ivermectin also depends on the infection being treated. Here we look at the doses for **[scabies](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-scabies-treatment-protocol-and-success-rates)**, strongyloidiasis, and onchocerciasis. Each condition needs a different plan. A doctor will change the dose based on what the person needs and how they respond to treatment.

It is easy to find your dose if you know your weight. Here is a step-by-step way to do it with a dose calculator.

To find your dose, multiply your weight in kg by 200 micrograms per kg. For example, a person who weighs 70 kg needs 70 x 200 mcg = 14,000 mcg, or 14 mg.

Some groups need special care. These include the elderly, people with liver or kidney problems, or those taking other medicines. The right dose for them may be different.

Getting the dose right is very important for treatment to work and to keep you safe. Here are some common mistakes people make and tips on how to avoid them.

**Ivermectin** comes in [tablets](/dosage-administration/ivermectin-tablets-vs-paste-vs-liquid-which-form-to-choose) of different sizes: 3 mg, 6 mg, and 12 mg. Knowing how to switch between these helps to get the correct dose. For example, you can take one 12 mg tablet and one 3 mg tablet, or two 6 mg tablets plus one 3 mg tablet.

How often and for [how long](/dosage-administration/how-long-does-ivermectin-stay-in-your-system "How Long Does Ivermectin Stay in Your System?") you take ivermectin depends on the illness and how you respond. Sometimes more than one dose is needed. Always see your doctor for checkups and advice.

In short, finding the right dose of ivermectin for a person means using their weight, the illness, and special health issues. Follow the rules and work with your doctor to get the best and safest treatment.
