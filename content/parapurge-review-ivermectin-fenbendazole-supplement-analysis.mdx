Parapurge is a health supplement that has gained interest for its possible role in fighting [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness "Ivermectin for Parasites: Types Treated and Effectiveness"). It is made by Free Range Health and contains two main drugs: **ivermectin** and fenbendazole. These drugs have long been used in animals, but now some are looking at using them in people. This has led to much talk and study.

Free Range Health makes supplements to help the body detoxify naturally. They say their products are made to support health in those looking for different options than regular medicine. They focus on quality and safety in what they make.

Understanding what is in Parapurge is key to judging if it works and if it is safe. The supplement has two main active parts: ivermectin and fenbendazole. Let’s look at each.

**Ivermectin** is a drug used to treat parasites in both people and animals. It works by attaching to certain channels in nerve and muscle cells, causing the parasite to become paralyzed and die. 

Fenbendazole is another drug used mainly in animals. It hurts the parasite’s microtubules, which are parts of its cell structure, and this kills the parasite.

Parapurge reviews are mixed. Some users report good results, and others do not see much change. We look at honest sources to give a balanced view. Overall, reviews show different results, so it is best to get medical advice suited to each person.

To judge how well Parapurge works, it’s important to look at both what users say and any clinical data that exists. There are few big studies on Parapurge itself. Still, the drugs inside it have been studied a lot.

Some reports say people see quick signs of improvement with Parapurge. But since there is little solid research on this supplement, these reports should be taken carefully.

When thinking about Parapurge, it’s good to compare how much it costs to buy the ingredients alone. Buying the drugs separately might be cheaper in the long run.

You can find discounts on Parapurge, sometimes saving up to 20%. This can make it cheaper for some. But buying the ingredients by themselves, especially if you have insurance or access to veterinary suppliers, may be less costly.

Compared to just ivermectin, which has been studied a lot and is approved by the FDA for some uses, Parapurge does not have as much proven effectiveness.

You should be sure to buy Parapurge from honest stores. This helps avoid fake products and guarantees quality. Buying from official sources is the best way to get a safe and good product.
