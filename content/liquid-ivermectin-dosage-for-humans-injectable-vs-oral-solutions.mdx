Liquid ivermectin is a drug used to treat many parasite infections. It comes in different forms, each made for specific use. It is very important to know the differences so it can be used safely and well. The main types of liquid ivermectin include oral solutions, shots, and creams or gels for the skin.

The oral liquid ivermectin is made for people to swallow. It is often used to treat diseases like **river blindness** and **strongyloidiasis**. This form is easy to give and allows for accurate doses based on body weight and the strength of the solution.

Injectable ivermectin is mostly used in animals to fight parasite infections. Sometimes, it has been used in people, especially where there is little access to pills. But, it is very important to note that veterinary shots are not approved for use in people. Their safety and how well they work in humans are not known. Using them can be risky.

[Topical](/dosage-administration/oral-ivermectin-vs-topical-choosing-the-right-form) ivermectin is used mainly for skin problems like head lice and [rosacea](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-skin-conditions-rosacea-and-dermatological-uses). It works on the skin’s surface and does not treat internal [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness "Ivermectin for Parasites: Types Treated and Effectiveness"). While it is good for its purpose, it does not give the full-body treatment needed for internal [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness).

When you give liquid ivermectin by mouth, knowing the right dose is very important for it to work well and to stay safe. The dose depends on the amount of solution and the person's weight.

The usual dose for most parasite infections is about 150-200 micrograms per kilogram of body weight. To find out how much liquid to give, follow these steps:

The dose in milliliters equals the body weight in kg times the dose in micrograms per kg, divided by the amount of ivermectin in the solution in micrograms per milliliter.

For example, for a person who weighs 70 kg using a 0.1% ivermectin solution:

- The recommended dose is 200 micrograms per kg.
- The solution has 1 mg/mL, which is 1000 micrograms/mL.

So, the calculation is:

Dose (mL) = (70 kg × 200 mcg/kg) / 1000 mcg/mL = 14 mL

It is very important to follow the advice of your doctor, as they may change the dose based on your health or other medicines you take.

Injectable ivermectin is meant for animals, not people. The FDA has not approved it for human use. Using animal shots in people can be dangerous because the purity, strength, or extra ingredients may not be safe for humans. This is why experts warn against it.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the FDA recommend only using ivermectin made for humans and given by a doctor. Do not use animal medicine for people.

Knowing that ivermectin liquids come in different strengths is key. They are most often found in two forms: 1% and 0.5% solutions.

A 1% solution has 10 mg of ivermectin per mL. It is used in animal medicine and sometimes for people if a doctor says so.

A 0.5% solution has 5 mg per mL. It is less common for use in humans. When changing from one strength to another, you must recalculate to give the right amount so you do not underdose or [overdose](/safety-side-effects/ivermectin-overdose-symptoms-treatment-safe-limits "Ivermectin Overdose: Symptoms Treatment & Safe Limits").

To do this, adjust the volume you give. For example, if you switch from a 1% to a 0.5% solution, you will need to give twice the amount to reach the same dose.

Getting the right dose of ivermectin liquid is very important for it to work well and be safe. Some tools and methods can help measure doses properly.

Using the right equipment and techniques ensures accurate doses. This helps the medicine work and keeps you safe.

When choosing between liquid or pill forms of ivermectin, think about how well they are absorbed, how effective they are, and how easy they are to give.

Both forms are absorbed well when used correctly. Liquids may get into the body faster since they do not need to dissolve first. But, the body takes up the same amount of medicine if the dose is the same.

For people who need special doses or adjustments, liquid ivermectin can be a good choice because it is flexible. But, pills are simple to use and need less prep work.

In all cases, it is best to follow your doctor’s advice and only use medicines they give you.
