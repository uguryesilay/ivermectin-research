**Ivermectin** is a well-known drug used to treat many parasitic infections, especially those caused by roundworms or nematodes. To understand what parasites ivermectin can treat, look at specific conditions like **strongyloidiasis** and ascariasis.

One common nematode treated with ivermectin is Strongyloides stercoralis. This small roundworm lives in the gut and causes strongyloidiasis. People with this illness may have stomach problems and skin rashes. The infection can last for many years if not treated.

Studies show that ivermectin is very good at killing Strongyloides. One dose of ivermectin has about a 90% chance of curing the infection. For serious cases, like hyperinfection, more doses might be needed. This shows ivermectin can be used flexibly to treat different levels of infection.

Another worm treated with ivermectin is Ascaris lumbricoides. These roundworms are common in many parts of the world, especially where sanitation is poor. They can cause stomach pain and malnutrition, mostly in [children](/dosage-administration/ivermectin-for-kids-pediatric-safety-and-dosing "Ivermectin for Kids: Pediatric Safety and Dosing").

**Ivermectin** is often given as part of programs to cut down the number of worms. The World Health Organization recommends using ivermectin with other drugs to fight these worms. Studies show ivermectin helps lower worm counts and helps patients get better.

Besides Strongyloides and Ascaris, ivermectin works against other worms like Trichuris trichiura and Enterobius vermicularis. These worms often occur together, so a broad treatment is needed. **Ivermectin** works by attaching to certain channels in the worms, causing paralysis and death. This makes it very useful in fighting parasitic diseases.

Ivermectin also treats skin conditions caused by mites and lice. These are not worms, but they are still called parasites. For example, [scabies](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-scabies-treatment-protocol-and-success-rates "Ivermectin for Scabies: Treatment Protocol and Success Rates") is caused by a tiny mite called Sarcoptes scabiei. It makes the skin itch and cause rashes. Ivermectin is a good option, especially if creams or lotions don’t work.

Head lice are another common problem. They are not life-threatening but can be hard to get rid of. An oral dose of ivermectin can kill lice. Some studies show that over 90% of lice are gone two weeks after treatment. This makes ivermectin a good choice if other treatments do not work.

*Demodex* mites live in hair follicles and are linked to skin problems like [rosacea](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-skin-conditions-rosacea-and-dermatological-uses "Ivermectin for Skin Conditions: Rosacea and Dermatological Uses") and blepharitis. Ivermectin in cream form has been approved to treat [rosacea](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-skin-conditions-rosacea-and-acne-treatment). It can help reduce the mites and ease symptoms. Studies show that patients see better skin and feel better after using it.

While ivermectin is a strong medicine, it has limits. It can kill many worms and some mites, but not all parasites in humans. Knowing what ivermectin can kill helps guide doctors in making plans for treatment.

Tapeworms are a common parasite, but ivermectin is not usually used against them. Instead, other medicines like **praziquantel** or **albendazole** are used. These drugs work differently and are better suited to tapeworms. If someone has symptoms of a [tapeworm](/medical-uses/tapeworm-treatment-does-ivermectin-work), they should see a doctor for tests and the right drugs.

Flukes, or trematodes, are flatworms that do not respond to ivermectin. These parasites need special drugs that match their shape and life cycle. Drugs like praziquantel work best against flukes, acting directly on them.

Treating fluke infections can be complex. It often needs both medicine and other methods to fully get rid of the parasites and stop new infections.

Protozoan infections are another type where ivermectin does not work. Diseases like malaria, caused by *Plasmodium* parasites, and giardiasis, caused by *Giardia lamblia*, need special drugs. Since protozoa are single-celled, they are very different from multicellular worms. Drugs like metronidazole are used to treat them.

Knowing how well ivermectin works against different parasites helps patients and doctors. Some ask, "Does ivermectin kill parasites well?" This section looks at success rates in different cases.

Ivermectin works very well against *Strongyloides*. It can cure over 90% of cases with just one dose. In very heavy cases, called hyperinfection, more doses might be needed to fully clear the infection.

For *Ascaris* worms, ivermectin’s success is better when used with other anti-worm drugs. This combination not only cures more cases but also cuts down on the spread of infection in areas where these worms are common.

Ivermectin is very good at treating **[scabies](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-scabies-treatment-protocol-and-success-rates)**. Studies show it can cure as well or better than creams and lotions. It is especially helpful during outbreaks or in people with large skin areas affected.

In head lice, ivermectin is a good choice, especially if the lice have become resistant to usual treatments. Its system-wide action kills both lice and their eggs, stopping relapse and spreading.

For *Demodex* mites, [topical](/dosage-administration/oral-ivermectin-vs-topical-choosing-the-right-form) ivermectin works well. It lowers mite numbers and relieves symptoms, especially in people with rosacea. Its anti-inflammatory effects help as well, making it useful for these skin conditions.

Ivermectin is also important in fighting tropical diseases. It is used to treat **river blindness** and elephantiasis, showing its importance worldwide.

River blindness, or **onchocerciasis**, is a bad disease caused by *Onchocerca volvulus*. Ivermectin is the main treatment. It cuts down the number of tiny worms and slows down the disease. The WHO recommends giving ivermectin to large groups to fight and stop the disease. These efforts have cut down how common the disease is and helped many lives.

Lymphatic filariasis, or elephantiasis, is another tropical illness. Ivermectin helps when used with other drugs like diethylcarbamazine. Giving these drugs to large groups helps stop the spread of the disease. It is part of a global push to end it.

In some cases, just ivermectin is not enough. To get the best results, doctors may need to use other medicines along with ivermectin.

In very heavy *Strongyloides* infections, especially in people with weak immune systems, using just ivermectin might not clear all the worms. Combining it with drugs like albendazole can help fully remove the infection.

People in areas where many parasites live often have more than one infection at a time. For these cases, doctors often use both ivermectin and other anti-worm medicines. This broad approach can treat all infections at once.

If parasites start to resist ivermectin, especially lice, combining treatments can help beat resistance and fully get rid of the parasites.

Ivermectin remains a key tool to fight parasites. It is effective for roundworms, mites, lice, and tropical diseases. It shows how useful and wide its use can be. Still, knowing when to use other medicines with ivermectin helps give the best care. This way, patients get the best chance to be free of parasites.
