The story of ivermectin and how it was found is a story of luck and careful work. It started in Japan in the 1970s. A scientist named Satoshi Mura looked for natural chemicals that could kill [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness "Ivermectin for Parasites: Types Treated and Effectiveness"). The key to ivermectin is a type of bacteria called Streptomyces.

These bacteria are known to make many important medicines. In the mountains of Shizuoka, Japan, Mura took many soil samples to find these bacteria. He found a strain called Streptomyces avermitilis. This bacteria made a compound with strong parasite-killing powers—avermectin.

This find was a big step. Avermectin worked well against many worms that infect humans and animals. It had a special way of working—attacking the parasites' nervous system—while being safe for the host. This discovery set the stage for making ivermectin, a new and better drug. It was a major moment in the history of medicine.

Mura worked with William Campbell, a researcher at Merck, a US drug company. Campbell's team made the drug stronger and safer. They refined avermectin into ivermectin. In the late 1970s, they created the drug. It was first used in animals in 1981, helping treat parasites in farm animals and pets. Its success in animals led to testing in humans. This was a big advance for global health.

In 2015, Mura and Campbell won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. They got this honor for their work on ivermectin. The prize recognized how their work helped reduce diseases like **river blindness** and lymphatic filariasis, which hurt millions in tropical areas. These diseases are caused by worms, and ivermectin has helped lower the number of people who get them.

**Ivermectin** has had a big impact on health. Since it was first used, it has helped wipe out some diseases and made life better for many people. It was a turning point in fighting these parasites. It especially helped in stopping river blindness and elephantiasis. River blindness is caused by a worm spread by blackflies. **Ivermectin** has helped control this disease in many places, stopping blindness and suffering. Elephantiasis causes severe swelling, and ivermectin, often with other drugs, has been key in efforts to wipe out this disease too. The WHO has led programs to give ivermectin to many people, cutting down how many get sick.

Mass drug programs have been very important. They give ivermectin to entire areas, whether people show signs of infection or not. This has broken the cycle of transmission and helped wipe out these diseases.

The story of ivermectin shows how useful and lasting this drug has been. Its many uses have led to studies into new ways to use it. Sometimes, people look into using ivermectin for other parasites or even viruses like [COVID](/medical-uses/ivermectin-and-covid-19-what-the-research-shows-2026-update "Ivermectin and COVID-19: What the Research Shows (2026 Update)")-19. But it is best to follow research and facts when choosing how to use the drug.

Knowing how ivermectin is made helps us see where it comes from. It starts with avermectin, made by the bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis. This bacterium is grown carefully in labs so that it makes avermectin. Then, the compound is changed chemically to make ivermectin.

**Ivermectin** is not made from plants. It comes from soil bacteria. Its making involves a careful process that makes sure the drug is pure and works well. This careful work makes ivermectin a safe and strong medicine.
