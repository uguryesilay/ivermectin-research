![Ivermectin And Covid 19 What The Research Shows 2026 Update](/images/ivermectin-and-covid-19-what-the-research-shows-2026-update-hero.webp)



The COVID-19 pandemic has led to more use of existing drugs for new uses, like ivermectin. This medicine was first used to treat [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness "Ivermectin for Parasites: Types Treated and Effectiveness"), but many studies have looked into how it might help with COVID-19. The question of how well ivermectin works against COVID-19 is hard. It involves many studies with different results.

Many big studies have checked if ivermectin helps with COVID-19. Early in the pandemic, some lab tests showed that ivermectin might stop the virus from copying itself in cells. But turning those lab results into real help for patients has been hard. Large reviews, such as one in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2024, said that ivermectin did not greatly cut death rates or hospital stays. Another big review in The Lancet in 2025 agreed and said we need better, well-made trials.

The first interest in ivermectin for COVID-19 came from lab studies. They showed it could lower the virus in cells. But these studies used high doses that are not safe for people. In real cases, the results have been less hopeful. A review in Nature Reviews Immunology pointed out that while ivermectin worked in labs, it did not do the same in real patients. Large, good studies show very little or no benefit from using ivermectin for COVID-19.

Many large trials have looked at ivermectin and COVID-19. The TOGETHER trial, done in many countries, found no difference in hospitalization between those who got ivermectin and those who did not. The ACTIV-6 study, part of the NIH efforts, also found that ivermectin did not help people recover faster or stay out of the hospital. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2025, with over 5,000 people, confirmed these results. It showed no big gains in health from ivermectin.

 The FDA and the WHO have given warnings about using ivermectin for COVID-19. As of 2026, the FDA has not given the green light to use ivermectin for this. They say the evidence is not enough and it may not be safe. The WHO also says not to use ivermectin outside of trials.

Even with these clear views, research into ivermectin and COVID-19 still goes on. Some new trials look at different doses or ways to give the drug, sometimes with other medicines. The International Journal of Infectious Diseases said in early 2026 that new tests are checking if ivermectin can help stop COVID-19 from forming in the first place. Results are not ready yet. These new studies try to fix past problems, like small size or poor design. It is important for patients and doctors to watch these studies, as they may change what we know.

Some claims have been made that ivermectin could stop COVID-19 or treat it. Many of these claims have little or no proof. Some reports and small studies did show some possible gains, but larger and better trials have not agreed.

Safety is very important when we use drugs for new reasons. **Ivermectin** is generally safe for its approved uses, but higher doses for COVID-19 have caused [side effects](/safety-side-effects/ivermectin-side-effects-complete-safety-guide "Ivermectin Side Effects: Complete Safety Guide"). These include upset stomach, dizziness, and rarely, serious nervous system problems. A study in 2025 in the Annals of Internal Medicine reported some bad **[side effects](/safety-side-effects/ivermectin-side-effects-complete-safety-guide)** in patients who took ivermectin for COVID-19. This shows that it is best to use the drug carefully and follow a doctor’s advice.

**Ivermectin**'s story as a possible COVID-19 cure shows how hard it is to find new uses for old drugs and how we need good, proof-based medicine. While early lab tests looked promising, big patient studies show little to no benefit. Health agencies have taken care to be cautious. More research is needed to know if ivermectin has a role in fighting COVID-19. As we face this new virus, it is key to get news from trusted sources and talk to health workers. Stay well, stay safe, and use only proven treatment methods.
