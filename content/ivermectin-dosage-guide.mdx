### For Strongyloidiasis (200 µg/kg)

**Ivermectin 3mg Tablets:**

| Body Weight | Weight Range (lbs) | Dose | Number of 3mg Tablets |
|-------------|-------------------|------|----------------------|
| **15-24 kg** | 33-53 lbs | 3 mg | 1 tablet |
| **25-35 kg** | 55-77 lbs | 6 mg | 2 tablets |
| **36-50 kg** | 79-110 lbs | 9 mg | 3 tablets |
| **51-65 kg** | 112-143 lbs | 12 mg | 4 tablets |
| **66-79 kg** | 145-174 lbs | 15 mg | 5 tablets |
| **80+ kg** | 176+ lbs | Calculate* | See below |

*For weights greater than or equal to 80 kg, calculate: (weight in kg × 0.2 mg) = total dose

### For Onchocerciasis (150 µg/kg)

**Ivermectin 3mg Tablets:**

| Body Weight | Weight Range (lbs) | Dose | Number of 3mg Tablets |
|-------------|-------------------|------|----------------------|
| **15-25 kg** | 33-55 lbs | 3 mg | 1 tablet |
| **26-44 kg** | 57-97 lbs | 6 mg | 2 tablets |
| **45-64 kg** | 99-141 lbs | 9 mg | 3 tablets |
| **65-84 kg** | 143-185 lbs | 12 mg | 4 tablets |
| **85+ kg** | 187+ lbs | Calculate* | See below |

*For weights greater than or equal to 85 kg, calculate: (weight in kg × 0.15 mg) = total dose

### Dosage Calculator Examples

**Example 1: 70 kg adult with strongyloidiasis**
- Calculation: 70 kg × 200 µg/kg = 14,000 µg = 14 mg
- Tablets needed: 14 mg ÷ 3 mg = 4.67 tablets (round to 5 tablets = 15 mg)

**Example 2: 90 kg adult with onchocerciasis**
- Calculation: 90 kg × 150 µg/kg = 13,500 µg = 13.5 mg
- Tablets needed: 13.5 mg ÷ 3 mg = 4.5 tablets (round to 5 tablets = 15 mg)

## How to Take Ivermectin Properly

![How to Take Ivermectin - Step by Step](/images/ivermectin-administration-timeline.webp)

### Timing and Administration

**Best Practices:**
- **Take on an empty stomach** with a full glass of water
- **Timing**: 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals
- **Morning dose**: Usually recommended for convenience
- **Single dose**: Most conditions require only one dose initially

**Why empty stomach matters:**
- Maximizes absorption
- Ensures consistent blood levels
- Reduces variability in effectiveness

### Food Interactions

**Avoid these around dosing time:**
- Heavy meals (especially high-fat foods)
- Dairy products
- Grapefruit juice (may increase ivermectin levels)

**Note**: For scabies treatment, some clinicians may recommend taking with food to increase bioavailability. Follow your doctor's specific instructions.

## Condition-Specific Dosing Guidelines

### Strongyloidiasis

**Standard Protocol:**
- Single oral dose of 200 µg/kg
- Take on empty stomach
- Follow-up stool examinations at 2-4 weeks

**Immunocompromised Patients:**
- May require repeated dosing every 2 weeks
- Some cases need monthly suppressive therapy
- Close monitoring essential

### Onchocerciasis (River Blindness)

**Treatment Schedule:**
- Single annual dose of 150 µg/kg
- May require treatment for 10-15 years
- Part of mass drug administration programs in endemic areas

**Mazzotti Reaction:**
- Common side effects from dying parasites
- Usually mild to moderate
- May include fever, itching, swollen lymph nodes
- See our [ivermectin side effects guide](/ivermectin-side-effects) for details

### Scabies (Off-Label)

**Typical Protocol:**
- Initial dose: 200 µg/kg
- Repeat dose: After 1-2 weeks
- May combine with topical permethrin

**Crusted Scabies:**
- Multiple doses may be needed
- Days 1, 2, 8, 9, and 15
- Combined with topical treatments essential

## Special Populations

### Pediatric Dosing

**Age/Weight Requirements:**
- **Minimum weight**: 15 kg (33 lbs)
- **Minimum age**: Generally not recommended under 6 months for topical; oral use typically for children greater than or equal to 5 years

**Pediatric Considerations:**
- Dosing follows same weight-based formula
- Extra caution with very young children
- Monitor closely for side effects

### Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

**Pregnancy Category C:**
- Use only if clearly needed
- Benefits must outweigh risks
- Animal studies show potential adverse effects

**Breastfeeding:**
- Ivermectin passes into breast milk
- Discuss timing of doses with healthcare provider
- May consider pumping and discarding milk for 24 hours after dose

### Elderly Patients

**Considerations:**
- No specific dose adjustments typically required
- May be more sensitive to side effects
- Monitor for dizziness and confusion
- Check for drug interactions (elderly often take multiple medications)

### Hepatic Impairment

**Liver Function Considerations:**
- Mild to moderate impairment: Usually no adjustment needed
- Severe impairment: Use with caution, may require dose reduction
- Monitor liver function tests
- Ivermectin is metabolized by the liver (CYP3A4)

### Renal Impairment

**Kidney Function:**
- Less than 1% excreted unchanged in urine
- No specific dose adjustments typically required
- Safe in chronic kidney disease
- Dialysis patients: Standard dosing usually appropriate

## What to Avoid While Taking Ivermectin

### Drug Interactions

**Medications that May Increase Ivermectin Levels:**
- **CYP3A4 Inhibitors**: Ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin

**Medications Affected by Ivermectin:**
- **Warfarin**: May increase bleeding risk (monitor INR)
- **Digoxin**: May increase serum levels
- Monitor closely if taking these medications

### Alcohol

**Recommendation:**
- Avoid alcohol during ivermectin treatment
- Alcohol may enhance sedative effects
- Can increase risk of dizziness and confusion

## Missed Dose Guidelines

**If you miss a dose:**
- For single-dose treatments: Contact your healthcare provider
- Do NOT double the dose
- Follow-up may be needed to assess effectiveness
