Ivermectin is a medicine used to kill certain [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness "Ivermectin for Parasites: Types Treated and Effectiveness") in humans. It has been approved by the FDA for specific uses. Here, we look at its main approved jobs: treating **onchocerciasis** and **strongyloidiasis**.

Onchocerciasis, often called **river blindness**, is caused by a worm called Onchocerca volvulus. It is found in parts of Africa and some Latin American areas. **Ivermectin** is the main drug used for this infection. It works by killing the tiny larvae called microfilariae that cause the disease. These larvae cause skin bumps, itching, and eye problems.

Strongyloidiasis is a disease caused by the roundworm Strongyloides stercoralis. It is found in warm parts of the world. **Ivermectin** is the best choice for this disease. It kills the larvae and stops the infection from spreading. It has a good safety record and works well.

**Ivermectin**’s uses go beyond these two diseases. It can treat many other parasitic infections, making it a useful tool worldwide.

It is also used in skin treatments. One common skin problem is [rosacea](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-skin-conditions-rosacea-and-dermatological-uses "Ivermectin for Skin Conditions: Rosacea and Dermatological Uses"). This causes redness, pimples, swelling, and small blood vessels in the face. Ivermectin cream is approved to treat the symptoms of [rosacea](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-skin-conditions-rosacea-and-dermatological-uses). It helps by reducing [inflammation](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-inflammation-research-anti-inflammatory-effects) and fighting tiny mites called Demodex, which may cause rosacea.

While rosacea is the main approved skin use, ivermectin may help with other skin conditions too. Some research shows it might work for other skin issues, but these uses are not officially approved yet. New studies are being done to find more ways that ivermectin can help.

Most of these off-label uses are still being tested. It is important to use ivermectin carefully and only with a doctor’s guidance.

Ivermectin was first made for animals. It is still used in veterinary medicine to treat many parasite infections. In animals, the doses are often higher and tailored to larger animals. Human doses are carefully set for each person’s needs.

Research keeps going, and new uses for ivermectin are being looked at. Clinical trials and studies try to find more ways it can help fight disease or resist germs. Some studies look at how ivermectin might be used with other drugs for better results.

As new research appears, the list of what ivermectin may do keeps growing. It remains an important drug today and may have many more uses in the future.
