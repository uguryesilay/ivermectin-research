The question of whether humans can take dog dewormer, especially those with ivermectin, has been discussed a lot recently. Ivermectin is a medicine used to kill [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness "Ivermectin for Parasites: Types Treated and Effectiveness") in both people and animals. But products made for dogs have different amounts and forms of ivermectin than those made for humans.

In human medicine, **ivermectin** is mainly used to treat diseases like **onchocerciasis** (river blindness), lymphatic filariasis, and **strongyloidiasis**. Its safety and help have been well studied by groups like the WHO and the FDA. A report in *The New England Journal of Medicine* says **ivermectin** works well and is safe when taken at the right dose for approved uses.

Dog dewormers with **ivermectin** are meant for dogs. They target parasites like heartworms and some worms in the gut. The amount of ivermectin in these products is often much higher than in human medicine. This can be dangerous if a person takes them.

When thinking about if humans can take dog dewormer, it’s important to see that there are other differences too. Many veterinary dewormers have ingredients to make them taste good for animals, like beef or chicken flavor. These ingredients may cause allergies or upset the stomach in humans.

Filler and preservative ingredients in dog medicine are not checked as carefully as medicines made for humans. These substances might cause bad interactions with other medicines or make health problems worse in some people.

A study in *Veterinary Parasitology* shows that small changes in how medicine is made can affect safety. People should only use medicines made specifically for humans to stay safe.

The dose of ivermectin in veterinary products is based on the weight and health of the animal. This is very different from the doses used for people. For example, a dewormer made for a big dog might have much more ivermectin than a person can safely take.

Doses for humans are carefully set to treat certain health issues without causing harm. An article in *The Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy* explains that taking too much can be dangerous, leading to nausea, dizziness, or worse, seizures and coma.

People should never try to give themselves dog dewormer based on guesses about doses. Instead, they should see a doctor to get the right treatment.

Safety is very important when it comes to medicines. Taking too much ivermectin can cause serious [side effects](/safety-side-effects/ivermectin-side-effects-complete-safety-guide "Ivermectin Side Effects: Complete Safety Guide") like low blood pressure, loss of balance, seizures, or coma, as shown in reports in *Clinical Toxicology*.

Some people have genes that make them more prone to ivermectin toxicity. This is more common in certain dog breeds, but it can also affect people. This shows why medical checks are needed before taking such medicines.

Medicines made for humans are tested to be safe and good. The FDA and WHO require many tests before they allow a medicine to be sold to people. These steps help protect patients from harm and make sure the drug works well.

Human medicines also consider other drugs a person might take, their health, age, and weight. This helps make sure the medicine is safe and effective. Guidelines from the CDC support this careful approach.

There are many kinds of ivermectin for dogs, each meant for different parasite problems. Some are pills, some are creams, and some are shots. Each type is made for a specific use in dogs. Pills might include other medicines to fight more parasites, while creams are for external bugs. Shots are used for bad infestations and need to be given by a vet.

Knowing how many types of veterinary ivermectin exist shows why you should only use medicines as they are meant for each animal. Using animal medicine for humans or vice versa without help from a doctor can cause harm. It is not safe to do so.

For the latest details on ivermectin, always talk to your doctor or visit the FDA website at www.fda.gov.
