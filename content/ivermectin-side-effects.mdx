- Anti-nausea medication can be used if needed

**Diarrhea:**
- Temporary and self-limiting
- Stay hydrated
- Contact doctor if severe or bloody

**Abdominal Pain:**
- Usually mild cramping  
- May be related to parasite die-off
- Should improve within a few days

**Loss of Appetite:**
- Temporary decrease in hunger
- Normal eating usually resumes within days
- Ensure adequate hydration

### Dermatological Reactions

**Skin Rash and Itching:**
- May be mild drug reaction or parasite die-off (Mazzotti reaction)
- Usually resolves on its own
- Antihistamines may provide relief

**When to Worry:**
- Severe rash with blistering
- Rash spreading rapidly
- Accompanied by fever or facial swelling

### General Symptoms

**Fatigue and Weakness:**
- Common after treatment
- Allow body to rest and recover
- Should improve within a week

**Muscle or Joint Pain:**
- Mild aches are common
- Over-the-counter pain relievers usually sufficient
- More common with treatments for onchocerciasis

## Mazzotti Reaction (For Onchocerciasis Treatment)

When treating river blindness, side effects are often related to dying parasites rather than the drug itself.

### What Is Mazzotti Reaction?

**Symptoms:**
- Fever and chills
- Intense itching
- Swollen and tender lymph nodes
- Joint and muscle pain
- Rapid heartbeat (tachycardia)
- Eye inflammation or irritation

**Management:**
- Antihistamines for itching
- Acetaminophen for fever and pain
- Corticosteroids for severe reactions
- Usually more severe with first treatment, milder with subsequent doses

**This is a NORMAL reaction** to successful treatment and indicates parasites are dying. However, severe reactions should be reported to your healthcare provider.

## Serious Side Effects (Require Immediate Medical Attention)

- Fainting
- Unresponsiveness
- Requires immediate emergency care

### Vision Problems

**Eye-Related Warning Signs:**
- Sudden vision changes or loss

- Light sensitivity with pain
- Blurred vision that doesn't improve

**Note:** Some mild eye irritation may occur with onchocerciasis  treatment (Mazzotti reaction) but sudden severe changes need immediate evaluation.

### Cardiovascular Symptoms

**Severe Rapid Heartbeat:**
- Heart rate greater than 120 bpm at rest
- Accompanied by chest pain or shortness of breath

**Dangerously Low Blood Pressure:**
- Extreme dizziness
- Fainting
- Cold, clammy skin

### Respiratory Distress

**Difficulty Breathing:**
- Shortness of breath
- Wheezing

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are side effects worse with higher doses?

Yes. Side effects are generally dose-dependent. Higher doses increase both the frequency and severity of adverse reactions. This is why proper [weight-based dosing](/ivermectin-dosage-guide) is critical.

### How long do side effects last?

Most common side effects resolve within 2-5 days. Mazzotti reaction from onchocerciasis treatment may last 1-2 weeks but gradually improves.

### Can I take pain relievers for side effects?

Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is usually safe for headache, fever, or body aches. Avoid NSAIDs like ibuprofen initially as they may mask serious symptoms. Always check with your healthcare provider.

### Is ivermectin safe for long-term use?

For approved indications like annual treatment of onchocerciasis, ivermectin has been used safely for decades. However, regular monitoring is important.

### What's the difference between drug side effects and allergic reactions?

**Side effects** are expected pharmacological responses. **Allergic reactions** involve the immune system and may include hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, and can be life-threatening.
