Independent pharmacies can also be a good choice. They may give more personal service and help find or order the medicine if it is not in stock now. This can be useful in small towns or for special needs.

When you find a store that might have ivermectin, call ahead. Ask if they have it and if you need a prescription. This can save you time and help you be sure before you go. By calling first, you can make sure it is worth the trip and that you get the right treatment.
