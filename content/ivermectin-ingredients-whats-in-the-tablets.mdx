## Active Ingredient

![Active Ingredient](/images/ivermectin-ingredients-whats-in-the-tablets-active-ingredient.webp)


When we talk about ivermectin ingredients, it helps to first know what the active part is. **Ivermectin** is a type of medicine called an anti-worm drug. It is made from a mix of chemicals called avermectins, which come from a bacteria named *Streptomyces avermitilis*.

### Ivermectin Chemical Structure and Purity

The main active part in ivermectin tablets is ivermectin itself. Chemically, ivermectin is a mix of two similar compounds: 22,23-dihydroavermectin B1a and 22,23-dihydroavermectin B1b. These work well to kill many [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness "Ivermectin for Parasites: Types Treated and Effectiveness"), such as Strongyloides stercoralis and Onchocerca volvulus.

Ivermectin's chemical shape is complex. It has a large lactone ring at its core. This shape helps it stop parasites from sending signals in their nerves by attaching strongly to chloride channels that are found only in parasites. This makes the parasite die.

Pharmaceutical-grade ivermectin must meet strict rules from groups like the FDA. The purity of ivermectin is tested to make sure it is safe and works well. The FDA says each tablet must have about 97-102% of the labeled dose of the active drug to ensure it works right.

## Common Inactive Ingredients

While the active ingredient makes the medicine work, the ingredients in ivermectin tablets also include some inactive parts. These help the medicine stay stable, work better, and be made properly.

### Fillers, Binders, and Coatings

Inactive ingredients, or excipients, have many roles:

- Fillers: These are used to add bulk to the tablet, making it easier to handle and swallow. Common fillers in ivermectin include lactose and starch.
- Binders: These agents help hold the tablet together. Binders such as microcrystalline cellulose ensure that the tablet maintains its shape and integrity until it is ingested.
- Coatings: Tablet coatings are used to protect the active ingredient from degradation, improve taste, and make the tablet easier to swallow. Hypromellose and magnesium stearate are commonly used coatings for ivermectin tablets.

These inactive parts are seen as safe and used in many drugs. Still, some people with allergies or sensitivities might have issues with certain inactive ingredients, which we will cover next.

## Allergen Considerations

![Allergen Considerations](/images/ivermectin-ingredients-whats-in-the-tablets-allergen-considerations.webp)


A common worry is if the ingredients in ivermectin tablets can cause allergies. Usually, the active drug does not cause allergies, but some of the inactive ingredients might for some people.

### Lactose, Gluten, and Other Allergens

- Lactose: Many ivermectin formulations contain lactose as a filler. For patients with lactose intolerance, this can lead to gastrointestinal discomfort. However, the amount of lactose in a single tablet is usually small and may not cause significant issues for most people.
- Gluten: Generally, ivermectin tablets are gluten-free. However, it is always advisable for patients with celiac disease or gluten sensitivities to confirm the gluten status of their medication with a pharmacist.
- Other Allergens: Some patients may have sensitivities to other excipients such as dyes or preservatives. It's important for individuals with known allergies to check with their healthcare provider or pharmacist to ensure that their specific formulation of ivermectin does not contain any problematic ingredients.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you have known allergies to any of the excipients in ivermectin, discuss alternative options with your healthcare provider.

## Brand Variations

When we look at ivermectin tablet ingredients, brands and makers may use different inactive parts. Even though the active drug stays the same, the extra ingredients can change how the medicine feels for the patient.

### Differences Between Manufacturers

Different makers may have their own mix of inactive parts in ivermectin tablets. These differences can affect:

- Tablet size and shape: Variations in excipients can lead to differences in the physical dimensions of the tablet, which may influence patient compliance.
- Taste and swallowability: Some coatings may alter the taste or ease of swallowing, which is particularly important for patients who have difficulty taking medications.
- Shelf-life and [storage](/safety-side-effects/ivermectin-shelf-life-storage-expiration-viability "Ivermectin Shelf Life: Storage Expiration & Viability") conditions: Different formulations may have varying storage requirements or shelf lives due to the stability provided by specific excipients.

It is best for patients to talk to their doctor or pharmacist if they change brands. This helps ensure the new medicine is right for them.

## Veterinary vs Human Ingredient Differences

![Veterinary vs Human Ingredient Differences](/images/ivermectin-ingredients-whats-in-the-tablets-veterinary-vs-human-ingredient-differences.webp)


Many ask how the **what is in ivermectin tablets** for humans compares to what is used in animals. The main drug is the same, but the recipes are not.

### Comparison of Formulations

- **Concentration**: Veterinary ivermectin products often contain higher concentrations of the active ingredient to accommodate larger animals like horses or cattle. Human formulations, on the other hand, are specifically dosed for human physiology.
- **Inactive Ingredients**: The excipients used in veterinary ivermectin may not meet the stringent purity and safety standards required for human medications. This can include differences in fillers, binders, and preservatives.
- **Regulatory Standards**: Human ivermectin is subject to rigorous testing and approval processes by agencies like the FDA, ensuring its safety and effectiveness for human use. Veterinary ivermectin is not held to the same standards for human consumption.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Never use veterinary ivermectin products for human health issues. The formulations are not interchangeable and can pose significant health risks.

In the end, knowing what makes up ivermectin tablets helps use them safely and well. The active drug is the same in all, but the extra parts can be different. This can matter for people with allergies or sensitivities. Always check with your doctor or pharmacist to be sure your medicine is right for your health.
