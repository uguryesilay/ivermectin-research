Understanding if medicines are safe during pregnancy is very important for women who are going to have a baby and for doctors. The question of whether it is safe to take ivermectin during pregnancy often comes up, since this medicine is used to treat infections caused by [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness "Ivermectin for Parasites: Types Treated and Effectiveness"). According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), ivermectin is in what is called pregnancy category C. This means that tests on animals show the medicine could harm the baby. There are no good or clear studies on humans yet. But, the benefits of using the medicine might sometimes be more than the risks.

The FDA’s category C tells us that there is little clear evidence from studies on people. So, using medicines like ivermectin during pregnancy should be done with care. Doctors need to think about whether the health of the mother or the need to treat her infection is more important than the small chance of harm to the baby. Pregnant women should talk to their doctors first to make a good choice.

Animal tests can show what might happen when a medicine is taken during pregnancy. For ivermectin, these tests are important for understanding possible risks.  

In tests on animals like rats and rabbits, giving ivermectin in high doses led to problems. These included birth defects and harm to the fetus. Effects seen were low birth weight, more baby deaths, and abnormal body parts. But, these tests used doses much higher than what humans take. It is hard to say if the same problems will happen in people. Still, these animal tests show that ivermectin should only be used during pregnancy if it is really needed and the benefits are bigger than the risks.

As we move from animal studies to human data, the question of safety stays open. 

There are only a few studies on humans, and they do not give a full answer. Some research done in places where [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness) are common, like in Africa, looked at women who took ivermectin by mistake during pregnancy. These studies did not find a clear link between the medicine and bad outcomes in pregnancy. Still, these studies had few women and many other factors, like poor nutrition or other infections, could affect the results.

One such study in Africa found that women who got ivermectin when they did not mean to did not have more pregnancy problems than other women. But, because the study was just observation, we must be careful about what it tells us.

When new babies are born, it is also important to know if ivermectin is safe for mothers who are breastfeeding.  

**Ivermectin** does pass into breast milk, but usually in very small amounts. Most studies show that less than 2% of the dose taken by the mother gets into the milk. This small transfer suggests that the risk to a baby who is breastfed is very low. Still, special care should be used, especially for very young or sick babies.  

If a mother needs ivermectin, she should talk with her doctor about the best way to take it. Sometimes, it might be best to wait or stop breastfeeding for a short time, to keep the baby safe.  

Deciding if a woman should take ivermectin in pregnancy is a careful step.  

Doctors must think about how bad the infection is, if there are other options, and what harm might come to the baby. If the infection is very serious, like severe **onchocerciasis** or **strongyloidiasis**, treating it may be more important than small risks. Not treating these infections can cause real harm and even be deadly, especially in women with weak immune systems. When the infection is less serious, doctors might choose other medicines or suggest waiting until after the pregnancy to treat.

The choice to use ivermectin during pregnancy should be made by the patient and her healthcare provider. They should think about each person’s case and the latest research.
