The availability of ivermectin over the counter has become a key topic in recent years, especially as states look at what rules to set. As of 2026, the federal rules say that ivermectin is mainly a drug that needs a doctor's permission. But individual states can change this rule if they want to.

**Ivermectin** is a drug that kills [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness "Ivermectin for Parasites: Types Treated and Effectiveness") and is used for many different things. It is usually only given with a doctor's help. The FDA says that for a drug to be sold over the counter, it must be safe for people to use without a doctor, have clear labels so users understand how to take it, and be something people can decide on their own if they need. The FDA makes the main rules, but states can pass their own laws to allow OTC sales in their area if they follow certain rules.

Only a few U.S. states have made ivermectin available over the counter. These states have set up rules to make sure people use it safely. This process requires work between state leaders, health groups, and local drug stores to keep the public safe.

Arkansas was the first state to allow OTC sales of ivermectin. This set a model for others to follow.

In 2025, Arkansas made a law to sell ivermectin without a prescription. The law looked at safety data and what the public needs. It says ivermectin can be sold without a doctor’s note but only under specific rules to keep buyers safe.

Arkansas has chosen certain pharmacies to sell ivermectin OTC. These stores must have trained pharmacists who can guide customers. The goal is to keep a safe space where people get the correct info on how to use ivermectin.

To buy ivermectin in Arkansas, customers must go to a participating pharmacy. They will have a quick talk with the pharmacist, who will ask questions to see if it is safe for them. This step helps make sure ivermectin is right for their health and condition.

After Arkansas, Tennessee also made ivermectin available over the counter, but with its own rules.

Tennessee’s law allows OTC sales of ivermectin with specific steps. It stresses that pharmacists must talk to customers first. Pharmacists are trained to judge if ivermectin is needed and to give advice on its safe use.

In Tennessee, this talk with the pharmacist is a key part of the process. Customers have to answer some questions so the pharmacist can decide if ivermectin is right for them. This helps prevent misuse or unnecessary use of the drug.

Many other states are now thinking about making ivermectin OTC. These states look closely at what will best protect health and follow the law.

States like Texas, Florida, and Ohio are studying the idea. They want to see how it would affect health care and public safety. Their decision will depend on how well Arkansas and Tennessee do with their rules.

The main points in these decisions are what people want, how easy it is to use the drug safely, and if stores and pharmacists have the right setup. Lawmakers, health workers, and experts all give their input in these rules.

If someone lives in a state where ivermectin is sold over the counter, knowing how to buy it is important.

Most times, you don’t need a doctor’s note to buy it. Still, it helps to have a list of your medicines and health issues, so the pharmacist can give better advice.

Pharmacists play a big role in this process. They are the first line to make sure ivermectin is used safely and right.

Pharmacists use checklists or forms to decide if it is safe to give ivermectin to each person. These forms ask about health history, current meds, and what the medicine will be used for.

Pharmacists are trained to explain [how to take ivermectin](/dosage-administration/how-to-take-ivermectin-timing-food-interactions-best-practices "How to Take Ivermectin: Timing Food Interactions & Best Practices"), tell about possible [side effects](/safety-side-effects/ivermectin-side-effects-complete-safety-guide "Ivermectin Side Effects: Complete Safety Guide") and interactions, and help people use it correctly. They make sure customers know what to do if they have any bad reactions.

Even though some states allow OTC sales, rules stay in place to protect groups who may be more at risk.

Most of these states set a minimum age of 18 for buying ivermectin. This helps make sure only adults, who can make their own health choices, buy the medicine.

To stop misuse, there are often limits on how much ivermectin can be bought at once. Usually, only one course of treatment is allowed per purchase, with restrictions on refills. This helps keep a doctor or pharmacist involved for safety.

In states where ivermectin is still a prescription-only drug, knowing how to get it is important.

In states where you need a prescription, you must see a licensed healthcare provider. They will check your condition and decide if ivermectin is right for you.

Online health services have made it easier to get prescriptions. You can talk to a doctor by phone or video, get an electronic prescription, and have the medicine sent to your home or local pharmacy.
