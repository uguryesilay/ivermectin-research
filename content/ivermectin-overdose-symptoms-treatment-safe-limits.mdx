Ivermectin is a drug often used to treat worms and [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness "Ivermectin for Parasites: Types Treated and Effectiveness") in people and animals. It has gained attention because some people misuse it or do not understand how to use it well. When taken as directed, it is generally safe. But it is important to know what happens if too much is taken and what the dangers are.

**Ivermectin** has a wide safe range, but taking too much can cause harm. In humans, the usual dose for infections is about 150 to 200 micrograms per kilogram of body weight. Overdose can happen if someone takes animal medicine meant for bigger animals or if they take too much of the medicine made for humans.

Studies show that doses over 2 milligrams per kilogram in humans increase the chance of being sick from the drug. But this limit can be different for each person, depending on health and other medicines they take.

Knowing the signs of taking too much ivermectin is very important. Some symptoms are mild, while others can be life-threatening. Quick action can help prevent serious problems.

An overdose can show up in many ways. Early warning signs help save lives. Common signs include: weakness, confusion, dizziness, stomach pain, and vision changes. More serious signs may include seizures, difficulty breathing, or loss of consciousness. These mean emergency care is needed right away.

Seeing the signs is only part of the job. Getting quick medical help is vital to stay safe.

Treating an overdose quickly involves key steps. First, call emergency services. While waiting, keep the person calm and comfortable. Do not try to make them vomit unless told to do so by a doctor. If possible, show medical staff what was taken and how much. Support vital signs with oxygen or IV fluids if needed. More specific treatments depend on symptoms and should be given by a health professional.

Anyone can have an overdose if they take too much ivermectin. But some people are more at risk. Factors such as age, health problems, or other medicines can raise this risk. Taking veterinary medicine, or medicine not prescribed for you, also increases danger. Being aware of these risks helps prevent mistakes and keeps people safe.

Prevention is better than cure. Safe use of ivermectin depends on following rules. Always take medicine as your doctor says. Do not share your medicines or take someone else’s. Read the instructions carefully. Store the medicine safely, out of reach of [children](/dosage-administration/ivermectin-for-kids-pediatric-safety-and-dosing "Ivermectin for Kids: Pediatric Safety and Dosing").

To stay safe, follow these tips: use the right dose, ask your doctor if you are unsure, and never use medicine made for animals. If you think someone took too much, seek help right away.
