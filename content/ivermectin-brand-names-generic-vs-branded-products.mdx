Ivermectin is a medicine that kills [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness "Ivermectin for Parasites: Types Treated and Effectiveness") and is well known for its good results. It was made in the late 1970s and has since become common in both human and animal health care.

The international name for ivermectin is just "ivermectin," a name used around the world. Chemically, it comes from a group called avermectins, which are large ring-shaped compounds made by the bacteria *Streptomyces avermitilis*. Its chemical formula is C<sub>48</sub>H<sub>74</sub>O<sub>14</sub>. **Ivermectin** works mainly by attaching to specific channels called glutamate-gated chloride channels in nerve and muscle cells of insects and worms. This causes paralysis and kills the parasite.

When people take ivermectin, it is sold under different brand names for different uses. Knowing the differences between these products can help people use them safely and correctly.

In animal health, ivermectin is a flexible drug. It helps prevent and treat many parasite infections in different animals. There are special forms of the drug made for different species.

The world needs a lot of ivermectin, which has led to many brand names. These brands are made for specific regions and rules.

Each brand name is more than just a label. It shows a way to fight parasites. Often, governments, doctors, and global groups work together to make sure these medicines work well.

Many patients wonder if generic medicines work as well as brand-name ones. This is an important question for ivermectin treatment.

The short answer is yes. Generic drugs contain the same active ingredient as the brand-name drug. They must meet strict rules set by agencies like the FDA or EMA. These rules make sure generics are equal in strength, safety, and how well they work. This means generics should work the same as brand drugs.

For more on how generics are tested, you can read our article on [FDA guidelines for generic drug approval](#).

In the end, whether you choose a generic or a brand-name ivermectin, follow your doctor’s advice. Knowing the differences and similarities can help you make the right choice. This understanding can boost your health and confidence in your care.
