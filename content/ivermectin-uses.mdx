Ivermectin fights many worms:
- Those inside the gut, like roundworms and strongyloides
- Tissue worms, such as onchocerciasis
- External parasites like lice and mites
- Some other worms

In areas where these bugs are common, ivermectin is given to many people at once. For one person, it is usually only used when a doctor confirms or strongly suspects an infection.

The drug stays in the body for about 18 hours and is mostly gone in 4-5 days. For more info, see our guide.

As of 2026, in some US states, people can buy ivermectin without a **[prescription](/buying-guide/how-to-get-ivermectin-prescription-and-access-guide)**. Still, the FDA warns that it should only be taken when a doctor says so, to be sure of the dose and safety.
