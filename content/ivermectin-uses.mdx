Ivermectin is a versatile antiparasitic medication with multiple FDA-approved and off-label uses. This comprehensive guide explores all current medical applications, helping you understand when and how ivermectin is appropriately used.

## Quick Overview

**FDA-Approved Uses:**
- Intestinal strongyloidiasis
- Onchocerciasis (river blindness)
- Head lice (topical)
- Rosacea (topical)

**Common Off-Label Uses:**
- Scabies
- Cutaneous larva migrans
- Lymphatic filariasis

Read our [comprehensive ivermectin guide](/ivermectin-comprehensive-guide) for more details on safety and dosing.

## FDA-Approved Medical Uses

### Intestinal Strongyloidiasis

Strongyloidiasis is a parasitic infection caused by the roundworm *Strongyloides stercoralis*. Ivermectin is the primary treatment.

**Key Points:**
- **Dosage**: 200 µg/kg as a single oral dose
- **Effectiveness**: Over 90% cure rate
- **Follow-up**: Stool examinations recommended 2-4 weeks post-treatment
- **Special Cases**: Immunocompromised patients may require repeated doses

**Symptoms Treated:**
- Abdominal pain and bloating
- Chronic diarrhea
- Skin manifestations (larva currens)
- Respiratory symptoms in disseminated cases

For detailed dosing information, see our [ivermectin dosage guide](/ivermectin-dosage-guide).

### Onchocerciasis (River Blindness)

Ivermectin revolutionized the treatment of river blindness, a disease that affects millions in Africa and Latin America.

**Treatment Protocol:**
- **Dosage**: 150 µg/kg annually
- **Duration**: May require multiple annual treatments
- **Mechanism**: Kills microfilariae (larval worms) but not adult worms
- **Prevention**: Mass drug administration programs in endemic areas

**Impact:**
- Prevents blindness and severe skin disease
- Has helped near-eliminate onchocerciasis in several countries
- Part of WHO's neglected tropical disease initiatives

### Topical Applications

**Head Lice (Sklice Lotion):**
- Single application to dry hair
- Leave on for 10 minutes
- Effective against lice and eggs
- Approved for patients 6 months and older

**Rosacea (Soolantra Cream):**
- Once-daily application
- Reduces inflammatory lesions
- Mechanism: Anti-inflammatory and anti-Demodex mite effects
- Visible improvement typically within 2-4 weeks

## Common Off-Label Uses

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Off-label uses should only be pursued under medical supervision. Always consult a healthcare provider.

### Scabies

While not FDA-approved for scabies in the US, ivermectin is widely used for this condition globally.

**Usage:**
- **Oral Dosage**: 200 µg/kg, may repeat after 1-2 weeks
- **Alternative**: Permethrin cream (recent 2026 research suggests may be more effective)
- **Crusted Scabies**: Higher doses and multiple treatments may be needed

Learn more about [ivermectin side effects](/ivermectin-side-effects) before starting treatment.

### Cutaneous Larva Migrans

This skin infection from animal hookworms responds well to ivermectin.

**Treatment:**
- Single dose of 200 µg/kg
- Symptomatic improvement within 24-48 hours
- Alternative: Topical thiabendazole

### Lymphatic Filariasis

Used as part of mass drug administration programs.

**Protocol:**
- Combined with albendazole or diethylcarbamazine
- Annual single-dose treatment
- Part of WHO elimination strategy

## Emerging and Investigational Uses

### Cancer Research

Recent studies have explored ivermectin's potential anticancer properties.

**Current Status (2026):**
- **Preclinical**: Shows promise in laboratory studies
- **Clinical Trials**: Phase I/II trial ongoing for triple-negative breast cancer
- **Evidence**: No proven clinical efficacy as cancer treatment yet

> [!WARNING]
> Ivermectin is NOT approved for cancer treatment. Never substitute proven cancer therapies with ivermectin. See our detailed [ivermectin for cancer research article](/blog/ivermectin-cancer-research) for more information.

### Malaria Control

The 2025 BOHEMIA trial showed promising results.

**Findings:**
- 26% reduction in malaria infections in children
- Used as complementary tool with standard interventions
- Particularly valuable given insecticide resistance

### COVID-19 (Not Recommended)

**Current Evidence:**
- Not FDA-approved for COVID-19
- Multiple studies show no significant benefit for mortality or hospitalization
- Major health organizations recommend against its use

## Veterinary Uses

Ivermectin is extensively used in animal medicine for:
- Heartworm prevention in dogs
- Parasite control in livestock
- Mange treatment in various species

> [!CAUTION]
> NEVER use veterinary ivermectin formulations for humans. They are highly concentrated and may contain ingredients harmful to people.

## When Ivermectin Is NOT Appropriate

**Do not use ivermectin for:**
- Viral infections (including COVID-19)
- Bacterial infections
- Fungal infections
- Cancer (except in approved clinical trials)
- Any non-parasitic condition

**Medical Contraindications:**
- Pregnancy (unless benefits outweigh risks)
- *Loa loa* infection (risk of encephalopathy)
- Severe liver disease (use with caution)

## How to Use Ivermectin Properly

### Before Taking Ivermectin

1. **Get Proper Diagnosis**: Ensure you actually have a parasite infection
2. **Consult Healthcare Provider**: Discuss your medical history
3. **Obtain Prescription**: Never self-medicate

- **Report any adverse effects** to your healthcare provider

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What parasites does ivermectin treat?

Ivermectin is effective against:
- Intestinal worms (strongyloides, some roundworms)
- Tissue worms (onchocerca)
- Ectoparasites (lice, scabies mites)
- Certain other nematodes

### Can ivermectin be used preventatively?

In endemic areas, ivermectin is used in mass drug administration programs to prevent parasitic diseases. However, for individual use, it's typically only prescribed when infection is confirmed or highly suspected.

### How long does ivermectin stay in your system?

Ivermectin has a half-life of approximately 18 hours, with most of the drug eliminated within 4-5 days. See our [comprehensive guide](/ivermectin-comprehensive-guide#pharmacokinetics) for more details.

### Is ivermectin available over-the-counter?

As of 2026, some US states allow OTC purchase, but the FDA strongly recommends obtaining it only through prescription to ensure appropriate use and dosing.
