Ivermectin is a drug that kills [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness "Ivermectin for Parasites: Types Treated and Effectiveness"). It works by messing with the nerves and muscles of these creatures. It binds to special channels called chloride channels, which are found on the surface of nerve and muscle cells. These channels are important because they control how ions move in and out of the cells. In [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness), these channels are key for their nerves to send signals and for their muscles to move. When ivermectin binds to these channels, it keeps them open. This causes a large amount of chloride ions to rush into the cells. The high level of chloride ions stops the nerve and muscle cells from working properly. This causes the parasite to become paralyzed and die. This is why ivermectin works on many parasites that cause diseases like **river blindness** and lymphatic filariasis.

To go deeper, we can look at how ivermectin interacts with GABA receptors. GABA is a natural chemical that slows down nerve signals in the brain and nervous system. It makes chloride ions go into nerve cells, which helps to calm their activity. **Ivermectin** makes these GABA receptors work even better by opening chloride channels more. This leads to too much inhibition of nerve signals, which causes paralysis in the parasite. At a molecular level, ivermectin boosts GABA's effect, making parasites unable to move or feed. In humans, this action is much weaker because of the blood-brain barrier. This barrier stops ivermectin from reaching GABA receptors in the brain, which helps keep humans safe from its effects.

Understanding how ivermectin kills parasites means looking at its effects on their nervous system. Parasites rely on their nerves to live and reproduce. When ivermectin disrupts their nerve signals, they become paralyzed. This stops them from moving, feeding, and making more parasites. It works best against worms and bugs because it affects how they move and stay alive inside their bodies. Studies show that ivermectin can cut down the number of tiny parasites called microfilariae in people with river blindness. Usually, one dose kills more than 90% of these parasites. This shows how ivermectin can fight these infections in the body.

A common worry is how ivermectin targets parasites without harming humans. This is due to the blood-brain barrier in humans. It acts as a shield that keeps ivermectin out of the brain and nerves. So, ivermectin mostly acts outside the brain in humans. Parasites, however, often do not have a good barrier, so ivermectin can reach their nerves easily. This difference helps keep humans safe while still killing parasites. It is a key reason why ivermectin is a safe and good medicine.

The way ivermectin moves through the body is also important. Its path helps explain how it works over time and how it keeps working to fight parasites. While it is best known for killing parasites, some studies show ivermectin may also help with other health issues. For example, it might help reduce [inflammation](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-inflammation-research-anti-inflammatory-effects) or fight some viruses. Some research suggests ivermectin could lower inflammation in skin conditions like [rosacea](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-skin-conditions-rosacea-and-dermatological-uses "Ivermectin for Skin Conditions: Rosacea and Dermatological Uses"). It may also block some parts of viruses from multiplying. During the [COVID](/medical-uses/ivermectin-and-covid-19-what-the-research-shows-2026-update "Ivermectin and COVID-19: What the Research Shows (2026 Update)")-19 pandemic, some studies tested if ivermectin could fight the virus. The results were mixed. Major health groups like the WHO and FDA say ivermectin should not be used to treat viruses like COVID-19. They say more research is needed to be sure.

In short, knowing how ivermectin works helps us use it in the right way. It can target parasites well while leaving human cells safe. This makes it a key tool to fight many parasitic diseases. But, like all drugs, ivermectin should be used only when a doctor says so. Its special design keeps humans safe and helps defeat parasites.
