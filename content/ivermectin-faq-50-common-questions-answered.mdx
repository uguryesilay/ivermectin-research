**Ivermectin** is a medicine first made from a type of bacteria called Streptomyces avermitilis. It is mainly used to kill [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness "Ivermectin for Parasites: Types Treated and Effectiveness"), such as worms, and is also used in animal vet work. It was first approved for use in people in the late 20th century. It has helped fight diseases like **river blindness** and lymphatic filariasis.

**Ivermectin** works by affecting how parasites' nerves work. It makes them stop moving and die. This makes it good at lowering parasite levels in people who are infected. The World Health Organization calls ivermectin an essential drug because it is so helpful for public health.

**Ivermectin** sticks to special channels in the nerves and muscles of parasites. It makes these channels let in more chloride ions. This causes the parasites to go stiff and die. It works against many parasites, like those that cause [scabies](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-scabies-treatment-protocol-and-success-rates "Ivermectin for Scabies: Treatment Protocol and Success Rates") and **strongyloidiasis**.

Lately, some studies look at whether ivermectin can fight viruses. Some lab tests show that it can stop viruses from copying in cells, but real tests in people are not yet clear. These effects need more research to be proven.

Most people can use ivermectin safely if a doctor says it is OK. It has been used by millions worldwide, especially in mass programs to fight parasites. But, like any drug, it can cause [side effects](/safety-side-effects/ivermectin-side-effects-complete-safety-guide "Ivermectin Side Effects: Complete Safety Guide"). 

A review from the FDA says ivermectin is safe if used the right way. Most **side effects** are mild, like dizziness, nausea, or diarrhea. Serious problems are rare but can happen if someone takes too much or takes it wrong.

Ivermectin is usually taken as a pill. The dose and how long you take it depend on which parasite you have. For example, a typical dose for strongyloidiasis is one dose of 200 micrograms per kilo of weight. Other infections may need different doses.

For animals, ivermectin comes in shots, pastes, and gels. These products are made for animals and should not be used in people. The doses and safety are different.

You can buy ivermectin with a **prescription** at a pharmacy. Always get it from a trusted source to stay safe. Be careful when buying online, because fake or poor-quality products are common. Always check if the shop is licensed and trusted.

Many myths about ivermectin exist, especially about its use to fight COVID-19. It is key to trust real science and talk to a doctor for advice.

Some false ideas are:

1. Ivermectin cures COVID-19.  
Current studies do not show it works for COVID-19. Groups like the FDA and WHO do not say you should use it for this.

2. You can take any dose of ivermectin.  
Take only the dose the doctor says. Larger doses do not make it work better and can cause harm.

3. Animal ivermectin is the same as the one for humans.  
The products are different in strength and safety. Do not use animal medicine on yourself.

Most people can use ivermectin well. **Side effects** are usually mild and include feeling dizzy, sick, or having diarrhea. Very rare side effects are severe skin rashes, dizziness that makes you fall, or low blood pressure. If you have serious symptoms, see a doctor right away.

Ivermectin can change how other medicines work. Tell your doctor about all drugs you take, including over-the-counter or supplements.  
For example, ivermectin can make blood thinners like warfarin work more, increasing the chance of bleeding. Combining it with other parasite drugs may cause more side effects. Always check with your doctor to stay safe.
