Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines for [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness "Ivermectin for Parasites: Types Treated and Effectiveness") give people an easy way to treat common infections. While medicines you need a doctor to get may work better for some, some OTC options do help for certain [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness).

Pyrantel is a common OTC drug used to treat [pinworms](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-pinworms-effectiveness-and-alternatives). Pinworms are small worms that cause itchiness around the anus, mainly at night. Pyrantel paralyzes the worms so they can be expelled from the body through natural digestion. It usually comes as a liquid or chewable pill.

**Permethrin** is mainly used for lice and [scabies](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-scabies-treatment-protocol-and-success-rates "Ivermectin for Scabies: Treatment Protocol and Success Rates"). This medicine is a cream or lotion you put on the skin. It kills the parasites by affecting their nerves. The CDC says permethrin is one of the best first medicines for lice and **[scabies](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-scabies-treatment-protocol-and-success-rates)** because it works well and is safe.

While pyrantel and permethrin help for certain infections, they are not cure-alls. It is important to know what each medicine can and cannot do. Using the wrong medicine for a certain parasite can mean it does not work.

**Ivermectin** is another medicine that has become more known during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is used to treat things like **river blindness** and **strongyloidiasis**. Unlike pyrantel and permethrin, **ivermectin** is not usually sold [over the counter](/buying-guide/ivermectin-over-the-counter-states-where-its-available-without-prescription) in the U.S. Its availability varies by state and local rules. Most states require a doctor’s **[prescription](/buying-guide/how-to-get-ivermectin-prescription-and-access-guide)** for it. This is because it can cause [side effects](/safety-side-effects/ivermectin-side-effects-complete-safety-guide "Ivermectin Side Effects: Complete Safety Guide") and needs medical supervision.

Before trying **ivermectin**, check if it can be used where you live. Talk to a doctor if you are thinking about using it.

Pinworms are common, especially in kids, and cause sleep and comfort problems. Luckily, many OTC medicines work for them.

Reese’s Pinworm Medicine is a well-known OTC treatment. It has pyrantel pamoate, which kills pinworms. It comes as a liquid, so it’s easy to give to children. Other brands, like Pin-X, also use pyrantel and work the same. These medicines are sold at stores and pharmacies.

When using these medicines, treat everyone in the home, as pinworms spread easily. Good habits like washing hands and cleaning bedding help stop reinfection.

For skin problems caused by tiny bugs, OTC creams and lotions can help. These are best for lice and **scabies**.

Lice are common, especially in school kids. OTC treatments like permethrin (Nix) and pyrethrin (Rid) are often used. Apply to the scalp and hair. Follow the directions carefully. It’s also a good idea to comb out nits and clean personal items and the home to stop the lice from coming back.

Scabies is caused by tiny mites that burrow into the skin. It causes intense itching. OTC permethrin cream, at 5%, is the main treatment. It’s put on from the neck down and left on overnight.

While OTC medicines are easy to use and carry, they do not work for all infections. Knowing their limits helps treatment go well.

Some infections need medicines from a doctor. For example:

- Giardia, which causes stomach issues, needs drugs like metronidazole or tinidazole.
- Malaria, a serious disease from mosquitoes, needs special medicines called artemisinin drugs.
- Tapeworms and flukes need specific medicines, such as **praziquantel** or **albendazole**.

While OTC options can treat some infections, it is best to see a doctor if you are unsure or if symptoms are severe.

- Persistent Symptoms: If your symptoms last or get worse even after using over-the-counter medicine, see a doctor. This helps find if there are extra problems or other infections.
- Severe Symptoms: Strong stomach pain, weight loss that you can't explain, or long-lasting fever may mean a serious parasite. This needs a doctor’s care.
- Travel History: If you have recently been to places where parasites are common and you get sick, see a doctor.

In conclusion, over-the-counter medicine for parasites can work for some cases, but it is important to know when you need to see a doctor. Knowing what options you have, their limits, and when to get help can lead to better health and effective treatment.
