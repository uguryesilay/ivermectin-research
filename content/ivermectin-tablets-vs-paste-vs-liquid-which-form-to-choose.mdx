When it comes to ivermectin, pills for people are the most common form used. These tablets are made for human use and meet strict rules set by groups like the FDA.

**Ivermectin** tablets usually come in 3 mg doses. They have a set amount of the active drug, ivermectin, mixed with other ingredients that help the medicine stay stable and get absorbed. These tablets are often used to treat [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness "Ivermectin for Parasites: Types Treated and Effectiveness") such as strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis. Sometimes, they are used off-label for conditions like [scabies](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-scabies-treatment-protocol-and-success-rates "Ivermectin for Scabies: Treatment Protocol and Success Rates") and lice.

**Ivermectin** tablets must be taken with care. Only a doctor should give them, because misusing them can cause serious health problems.

The usual dose depends on what is being treated, how much the person weighs, and their health. For **strongyloidiasis**, a common dose is one single pill of 200 micrograms per kilogram. Many studies, including one from the New England Journal of Medicine, show that ivermectin tablets work well to lower parasite levels in patients with **onchocerciasis**.

**Ivermectin** paste is mainly made for pets, mainly horses. It treats different worms and parasites on animals. It is packed in syringes for easy use, with doses made to match the animal’s weight. It is very important to know that veterinary paste is not meant for humans. Using it can lead to bad [side effects](/safety-side-effects/ivermectin-side-effects-complete-safety-guide "Ivermectin Side Effects: Complete Safety Guide") because it is made for animals, not people.

Liquid forms of ivermectin are available for animals, in both oral and injectable types. Sometimes, oral ivermectin solutions are used in humans, especially in areas with many parasites.

In veterinary care, whether to give the medicine by mouth or by shot depends on what the animal needs and which method is easier.

When we look at how well these forms work, how the medicine is absorbed into the body is key. Bioavailability is how much and how fast the drug gets into the blood and to where it works.

Research shows that although all forms can treat parasitic infections, pills for humans give the most steady and reliable absorption.

When measuring ease of use, oral ivermectin pills are best because they are simple and precise. Many patients find that pills are quick and safe to take. In mass treatments, their simple form makes it easy to give many people medicine at once.

Cost is another important factor. The price of each form can vary a lot. One study in The Lancet looks at how ivermectin helps public health and says that pills are often the best choice because they cost less and are easy to give to large groups.

In the end, ivermectin tablets are the best for human use. They give a safe, reliable dose and cost less. They help treat parasitic infections well and reduce the chance of **side effects**. Always talk with a doctor to find the best form and dose for your needs.
