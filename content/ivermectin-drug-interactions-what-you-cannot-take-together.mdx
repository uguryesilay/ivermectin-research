Ivermectin is a drug often used to fight [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness "Ivermectin for Parasites: Types Treated and Effectiveness"). It works well for many infections, but it can have bad interactions with other medicines. Knowing about these can help keep you safe and get good results from your treatment.

**Ivermectin** can react badly with some drugs, making [side effects](/safety-side-effects/ivermectin-side-effects-complete-safety-guide "Ivermectin Side Effects: Complete Safety Guide") worse or lowering the drug’s power. Some key interactions are:

- Benzodiazepines: Drugs like diazepam or lorazepam can cause too much sleepiness, slow breathing, or even coma when taken with ivermectin. They make your brain calmer than it should be.

- Seizure medicines: Drugs like valproic acid and carbamazepine can lower ivermectin’s effect. They can speed up how your liver breaks down ivermectin.

- Fungal medicines: Azole drugs such as ketoconazole can raise ivermectin levels in your blood. This can increase **[side effects](/safety-side-effects/ivermectin-side-effects-complete-safety-guide)** like dizziness and confusion.

- Heart medicines: Calcium channel blockers like verapamil can also boost ivermectin in your body. This might cause poisoning or other problems.

Blood thinners, or anticoagulants, are drugs that stop blood clots. They are often used to prevent strokes or heart attacks. When you take ivermectin with these drugs, there can be risks.

Warfarin is a common blood thinner. It can change how your body breaks down ivermectin. This can make warfarin work too much or too little. The effect on blood clotting, measured by INR, can change. So, people on warfarin should have their INR checked often when they start or stop ivermectin. Your doctor may need to change your warfarin dose.

Many ask if they can take ivermectin with antibiotics. The safety depends on which antibiotic you use.

- Macrolides like erythromycin and clarithromycin: These can block the enzymes in your liver that break down ivermectin. This can raise ivermectin’s level and cause **side effects**.

- Tetracyclines: These drugs, like doxycycline, rarely affect ivermectin. They are generally safe to use together.

- Penicillins and cephalosporins: These are safe with ivermectin, as they don’t change how ivermectin is processed in the body.

Supplements are often seen as safe, but they can change how drugs like ivermectin work.

Certain supplements can block the absorption or action of ivermectin:

- Activated charcoal: Used to remove toxins, this can bind to ivermectin in your gut. It reduces how much ivermectin gets into your blood.

- Fiber supplements: High-fiber products can also trap ivermectin, lowering its effect.

- Calcium and magnesium: These minerals in supplements can interfere with how ivermectin is absorbed, similar to some antibiotics.

Many ask if they can drink alcohol while taking ivermectin. It is best to be careful.

- More side effects: Alcohol can make side effects like dizziness, nausea, and sleepiness worse. This can lead to falls or accidents.

- Liver load: Both alcohol and ivermectin are processed by your liver. Drinking can put extra stress on this organ and cause damage or lessen its function.

- Weakened immune system: Alcohol can harm your immune defense. This can make it harder for ivermectin to help you fight infection.

The enzyme CYP3A4 helps break down ivermectin in your body. Some medicines can block this enzyme and make ivermectin build up too much, risking [overdose](/safety-side-effects/ivermectin-overdose-symptoms-treatment-safe-limits "Ivermectin Overdose: Symptoms Treatment & Safe Limits").

- HIV medicines: Drugs like ritonavir inhibit CYP3A4. This can cause ivermectin to rise too high.

- Heart drugs: Verapamil and others also block CYP3A4. They can raise ivermectin levels.

- Fungal medicines: Azoles like itraconazole shut down CYP3A4. They can slow the breakdown of ivermectin, raising its levels.

Understanding these interactions is key. Always tell your doctor about all medicines and supplements you take. This helps ensure you get the best care and avoid dangerous interactions.
