When people ask about ivermectin's [shelf life](/buying-guide/ivermectin-shelf-life-storage-expiration-guidelines), they usually want to know the expiration date from the maker. This date shows [how long](/dosage-administration/how-long-does-ivermectin-stay-in-your-system "How Long Does Ivermectin Stay in Your System?") the medicine is expected to stay stable and work well if stored properly. For most forms of ivermectin, the shelf life is about two to three years from the date it was made. This is true for pills and creams used on the skin.

The expiration date is set after tests are done by the maker. These tests check how the drug holds up under certain conditions. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) asks for these tests. They make sure the medicine keeps its strength and is safe until the expiration date.

The shelf life for ivermectin pills is usually between two and three years. These pills are used to treat parasite infections, and it is very important they work well. Other forms, like creams or lotions for skin problems such as [rosacea](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-skin-conditions-rosacea-and-dermatological-uses "Ivermectin for Skin Conditions: Rosacea and Dermatological Uses"), might have different shelf times. Their shelf life depends on how they are made and packed.

One common question is, "Does ivermectin expire if I don't store it right?" The answer is yes. Proper storage is very important to keep the medicine working well for its full shelf life.

The rules for storing ivermectin help protect it from things that can make it break down faster. Here are some tips to store it right:

Many people ask, "Does ivermectin go bad?" Over time, like other medicines, it can lose some of its strength and might not be safe to use. Knowing how it breaks down helps you make smart choices about when to take or throw it away.

How long ivermectin lasts depends on how long it has been stored and how. It is known that if kept right, it can stay stable for a long time. But if stored poorly, it can break down. The chemical make-up of ivermectin makes it sensitive to water, heat, and light, which can speed up the process of losing strength.

Studies show that ivermectin stays stable when stored at the right temperature and conditions. For example, a study in the *Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences* said that high heat can cut its strength a lot. So, it is very important to follow the storage rules.

Some ask if it is safe to use ivermectin past the expiration date. Sometimes medicines may still work a little after that date, but it is not safe to rely on expired ivermectin. Using expired medicine is not recommended as it may not work well and could cause harm. The drugs may have broken down into forms that might be unsafe, though we have little data on these parts for ivermectin.

If a patient finds that their ivermectin has expired, especially when they need it for a parasite infection, they should see a doctor. The doctor can give a new [prescription](/buying-guide/how-to-get-ivermectin-prescription-and-access-guide "How to Get Ivermectin: Prescription and Access Guide") so the patient gets the right treatment.

Many want to know how to make ivermectin last longer. The key is to store it well. The date it is safe to use does not change, but good storage can keep it effective until then.

To make ivermectin last as long as possible, follow these rules:

Keep it in a cool, dry place. Avoid heat, light, and moisture. Keep the container tightly closed. Store it away from direct sunlight and humid areas. Follow the instructions on the label for best storage.

In the end, knowing how long ivermectin lasts and how to store it properly helps ensure it works well and is safe to use. If you have questions, talk to your healthcare provider. Follow their advice and check the FDA website for the latest updates.
