Stromectol, a brand name for ivermectin, is a drug made by Merck & Co. It is mainly used to treat infections caused by certain [parasites](/medical-uses/ivermectin-for-parasites-types-treated-and-effectiveness "Ivermectin for Parasites: Types Treated and Effectiveness"). **Ivermectin** was first approved for use in animals in 1981. Later, it was approved for people. This helped in the fight against many parasitic diseases. Stromectol was made as a medicine for humans. It gives a steady and reliable way to treat certain parasitic infections.

The active part of Stromectol is ivermectin. It belongs to a group of drugs called avermectins. It works by attaching to special chloride channels in the nerves and muscles of parasites. This causes paralysis and kills the parasites. This method works well against many parasites, like those that cause **river blindness** (onchocerciasis) and **strongyloidiasis**.

Merck's launch of Stromectol was a big step forward for public health. The form of Stromectol is carefully made to work well and be easy to use. Each pill is designed to give the right dose for good treatment. Strict quality checks are in place to keep the medicine safe and consistent.

The name Stromectol has become a sign of a trusted way to fight parasitic infections. It has brought hope to many people with these tough diseases. As we look more into Stromectol, it is good to know how it is different from generic versions and how it fits into modern medicine.

When choosing treatment, patients and doctors often compare brand-name drugs like Stromectol with their generic versions, such as generic ivermectin. Knowing these differences helps make better choices about treatment.

Both Stromectol and generic ivermectin have the same active ingredient, ivermectin. They are usually considered equally effective. They must meet strict rules set by the FDA. This makes sure the generics are the same in strength, safety, and quality as the brand-name. They have the same dose, form, and use.

The main difference is cost. Generic ivermectin is usually much cheaper than Stromectol. This price gap is because generics don’t have the costs for research and marketing that brand names do. For many patients, the lower cost of generics makes them a good choice, especially if insurance helps pay. 

Both options work well, but the choice depends on what is available, personal preferences, and advice from a healthcare provider. Patients should talk with their doctor to find the best option for their needs.

It is also important to know the strengths of Stromectol. It is usually sold in 3mg tablets.

Each 3mg pill of Stromectol provides a good dose of ivermectin. The tablets are often scored, which means they can be split easily. This helps if a smaller dose is needed, such as for children or based on weight. The pills are taken by mouth, with or without food, depending on what is being treated. Following the doctor’s instructions is key to making sure the treatment works well and [side effects](/safety-side-effects/ivermectin-side-effects-complete-safety-guide "Ivermectin Side Effects: Complete Safety Guide") are minimized. Patients should always follow the dose given by their doctor. Sometimes, a doctor may suggest more than one dose or extra treatment. Follow-up visits and checks are important for good treatment results with Stromectol.

Stromectol, as a form of ivermectin, is approved by the FDA for certain uses. Knowing what these are and how to use the medicine safely is very important.

Stromectol is approved to treat:

Protected information, such as specific conditions and dosages, is not shown here.

The dose of Stromectol depends on a patient’s weight. Because of this, it’s important to measure weight accurately before starting treatment. Sometimes, a doctor will change the dose based on how the patient responds and tolerates the medicine.

Cost is an important issue when choosing Stromectol over generic ivermectin. For many patients and health systems, this matters a lot.

Brand-name Stromectol usually costs more than the generic. This extra cost covers the money spent on research, development, and marketing. Some patients see the trust and reliability of the brand as worth the extra cost.

Generic ivermectin is often much cheaper. This makes it a good choice for those without insurance or with high copays. Here is a simple table to compare the costs of the two options.

These price ranges are rough estimates and can change depending on where you live, the pharmacy's prices, and what your insurance covers. Patients are advised to look into both options and ask their doctors or pharmacists about ways to save money, such as assistance programs or discount cards.

The availability of Stromectol can vary, affecting how patients access the medicine and their treatment choices.

Stromectol is still made, providing an important treatment for people who need help with parasitic infections. But its availability may go up or down based on supply chain issues, demand in different areas, and rules from authorities.

Patients can usually find Stromectol at most pharmacies, though in some places it may need to be ordered. While Stromectol is still available, the fact that generic ivermectin is widely sold has made it easier and cheaper for many people.

Patients should work closely with their doctors and pharmacists to find the best way to get Stromectol if that is the right treatment. If it is not easy to find, generic ivermectin offers a similar and effective choice.
