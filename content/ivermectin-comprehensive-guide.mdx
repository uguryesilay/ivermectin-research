## What is Ivermectin?

Ivermectin is a highly effective antiparasitic medication that has been a cornerstone of global health for over four decades. Discovered in the late 1970s, this medication earned its developers the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for its profound impact on treating parasitic diseases affecting millions worldwide.

**Key Facts:**
- **Drug Class**: Antiparasitic agent (anthelmintic and ectoparasiticide)
- **Primary Use**: Treatment of parasitic infections in humans and animals
- **FDA Status**: Approved for specific parasitic conditions
- **Availability**: Prescription-only in the United States
- **Forms**: Oral tablets, topical cream, topical lotion

Ivermectin works by paralyzing and killing parasites, making it particularly effective against certain worms, mites, and lice. The medication has been distributed billions of times through mass drug administration programs, preventing blindness and disfigurement for millions of people in developing countries.

For a detailed breakdown of all medical applications, see our [complete guide to ivermectin uses](/ivermectin-uses).

## FDA-Approved Uses

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ivermectin for the following human medical conditions:

![FDA-Approved Uses of Ivermectin](/images/ivermectin-fda-approved-medical-uses.webp)

### Intestinal Strongyloidiasis**

Strongyloidiasis is a parasitic infection caused by the roundworm *Strongyloides stercoralis*. This infection can be particularly dangerous in immunocompromised individuals.

**Symptoms include:**
- Abdominal pain and bloating
- Diarrhea or constipation
- Skin rashes (larva currens)
- Cough and wheezing

**Treatment:**
- Ivermectin tablets (Stromectol®): 200 µg/kg as a single dose
- Follow-up stool examinations recommended

### Onchocerciasis (River Blindness)**

Onchocerciasis is caused by the parasitic worm *Onchocerca volvulus*, transmitted through blackfly bites. It's a leading cause of preventable blindness in tropical regions.

**Characteristics:**
- Affects approximately 21 million people globally
- Primarily found in sub-Saharan Africa
- Can cause severe itching, skin lesions, and vision loss

**Treatment:**
- Ivermectin tablets: 150 µg/kg as a single annual dose
- May require repeated annual treatments

### Topical Formulations**

**Ivermectin Cream (Soolantra®):**
- Approved for inflammatory lesions of rosacea in adults
- Applied once daily to affected areas

**Ivermectin Lotion (Sklice®):**
- Approved for head lice in patients 6 months and older
- Single-application treatment

### Off-Label Uses

While not FDA-approved for these conditions, ivermectin is sometimes prescribed off-label for:
- Scabies (though recent 2026 research suggests permethrin may be more effective)
- Other parasitic infections under medical supervision

Learn more about all approved and off-label [ivermectin uses](/ivermectin-uses).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Important**: Ivermectin should only be used for FDA-approved indications or under the guidance of a qualified healthcare provider. Self-medication can be dangerous.

## How Ivermectin Works

### Mechanism of Action

Ivermectin belongs to a class of drugs called macrocyclic lactones. It works through a sophisticated mechanism that targets parasites while remaining safe for humans:

![Ivermectin Mechanism of Action](/images/ivermectin-mechanism-of-action-diagram.webp)

**Chloride Channel Activation:**
- Binds to glutamate-gated chloride channels in parasite nerve and muscle cells
- Causes increased permeability to chloride ions
- Results in hyperpolarization of parasite cells

**Paralysis and Death:**
- Disrupts neurotransmission in parasites
- Leads to paralysis and eventual death of the organism
- Does not significantly affect mammalian nerve cells

**Selective Toxicity:**
- Parasites lack the blood-brain barrier protection present in mammals
- Higher concentrations accumulate in parasite nervous systems
- Minimal impact on human neural function at therapeutic doses

### Pharmacokinetics

**Absorption:**
- Rapidly absorbed after oral administration
- Peak plasma concentrations: 4-5 hours
- Fat-containing meals increase absorption by approximately 2.5-fold

**Distribution:**
- Widely distributed in body tissues
- High lipophilicity (fat-soluble)
- Limited penetration of blood-brain barrier in humans

**Metabolism:**
- Primarily metabolized in the liver
- Multiple metabolites formed
- Main enzyme: CYP3A4

**Elimination:**
- Half-life: Approximately 18 hours (can range 16-35 hours)
- Excretion: Primarily through feces
- Less than 1% excreted unchanged in urine

## Dosage Guidelines

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I buy ivermectin over the counter?

As of 2026, several U.S. states (Arkansas, Idaho, Louisiana, Tennessee, Texas) have passed legislation allowing OTC sales. However, the FDA recommends obtaining ivermectin only through a prescription from a licensed healthcare provider to ensure appropriate use and dosing.

### Is ivermectin effective against COVID-19?

No. Ivermectin is not FDA-approved for COVID-19, and current evidence does not support its use for this condition. Multiple systematic reviews have shown it does not significantly improve important outcomes like mortality or hospitalization.

### How long does ivermectin stay in your system?

Ivermectin has a half-life of approximately 18 hours. It typically takes about 5-6 half-lives for a drug to be eliminated from the body, meaning ivermectin is largely cleared within 4-5 days after the last dose.

### Can I drink alcohol while taking ivermectin?

While there's no absolute contraindication, alcohol may enhance the sedative effects of ivermectin. It's best to avoid alcohol during treatment and consult your healthcare provider.

### Is ivermectin safe during pregnancy?

Ivermectin is Pregnancy Category C. It should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Always discuss with your healthcare provider.

### Can ivermectin be used for scabies?

While ivermectin is sometimes used off-label for scabies, recent 2026 research suggests that permethrin cream may be more effective. Consult a dermatologist for the most appropriate treatment.
